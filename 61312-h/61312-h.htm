<p class="p1" />
<p>The campaign of the Twenty-seventh Regiment Connecticut
Volunteers began in the most critical and anxious
period of the war against the rebellion&mdash;the year
1862. After long months of diligent preparation, the
Army of the Potomac opened the year with its first
memorable advance against the rebel capital. The inspiring
faith of all loyal hearts followed every step of
its progress up the Peninsula, toward the stronghold of
treason; and when the shattered but undaunted remnants
retreated down the James river, and hurried to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
defence of the national capital, menaced by an exultant
foe, deep was the disappointment which filled the whole
North. Every ear was strained to catch the result of
the conflict before Washington, only to hear that the
rebels had been partially successful, and were crossing
the Potomac into Maryland and Pennsylvania. Those
were days of profound anxiety, but not of weak irresolution.
Each new disaster seemed to bring the people
nearer to a realization of the magnitude of the struggle,
and nerve them to fulfil the imperative duties of the
hour. The President, early in July, issued his Proclamation,
calling for three hundred thousand men, to serve
for three years; and on the fourth of August following
summoned to the field three hundred thousand more, to
serve for nine months. The Twenty-seventh Regiment
was organized under this latter call. Its members were
recruited from New-Haven county, and mainly from the
city of New-Haven, with considerable numbers from
Madison, Milford, Meriden, Wallingford, Branford,
Clinton, and Guilford, and still smaller quotas from other
neighboring towns.</p>

<p>The character and material of the regiment well illustrated
the heartiness with which all classes responded to
the earnest call of the President in those dark days of
the Republic. Every variety of condition and employment
found representatives in the Twenty-seventh. The
agricultural population of the county responded with a
goodly number of the votaries of Ceres. Many of the
most respected and enterprising mechanics and business
men of the community laid aside for a season the implements
of their labor to join its ranks. Members
of the press exchanged pen and type for sword and
bayonet. There were also several accomplished engineers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
in the regiment, one of whom was detailed in that
department, on the staff of General W. S. Hancock, and
had charge of the General’s topographical maps and
plans of battles. The public schools of the city contributed
one of their most esteemed teachers, who gave
his life on the field of Fredericksburg; and in the room
where of yore he so successfully led on his pupils from
step to step in knowledge, hangs his portrait, to them a
daily-recurring lesson of noble patriotism and self-devotion.
Also the various professions furnished of their
members; and old Yale, never faithless to the patriotic
instincts of her Revolutionary sons, was represented by
several of her graduates and students, one of whom was
a color-bearer of the regiment at Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville,
and Gettysburg.</p>

<p>The first company went into camp at Camp Terry,
New-Haven, in the latter part of August, and by the
middle of September the whole number of companies
were on the ground, with nearly a full quota of men.
Being technically a militia regiment, the choice of field
officers was vested in those of the line. Richard S.
Bostwick, of New-Haven, was elected Colonel; Henry
C. Merwin, of the same place, Lieutenant-Colonel; and
Theodore Byxbee, of Meriden, Major; all of whom,
with a number of the company officers, had been connected
with the three-months volunteers at the beginning
of the war. After several weeks spent in perfecting
the organization and equipment, the regiment was
mustered into the United States service, October twenty-second,
1862, for the term of nine months, and started
for the field in the evening of that day, numbering eight
hundred and twenty-nine, rank and file.</p>

<p>Without stopping to dwell upon the passage to New-York,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
to Port Monmouth, or upon the generous hospitality
of the Quaker City, and passing by the night
journey to Baltimore, succeeded by a day’s rest on the
pavements of that city, the morning of the twenty-fifth
found us in Washington. Camp Seward, on Arlington
Heights, is soon reached, and quickly long rows of tents
rear their white roofs in General Lee’s peach orchard.
Possibly in other days we should have been summarily
ejected by a grand charge of that gentleman’s dusky
retainers, or perhaps indicted in the courts for presuming
to trespass upon the domain of an F. F. V., and
have paid dearly to appease his injured feelings. But
now the crowd of slaves is dispersed, and “Massa Lee”
is not there to dispute our right to possession.</p>

<p>Our introduction to the Old Dominion would be incomplete
unless the foreground of the picture presented
to view that bugbear, Virginia mud, which has made
and unmade so many Generals, and stopped the wheels
of the Army of the Potomac with periodical regularity.
We had hardly arrived at Camp Seward when the clouds
began to marshal their forces for an illustration of their
power to change the sacred soil into a sea of mud; and
as if to show the minutiæ of the forming process, it
began to drizzle slowly; the mist gradually enlarged
into drops, and the soil grew softer and softer. As we
floundered about, we began to realize that the aforesaid
mud was not altogether a myth, conjured up by inefficient
commanders to excuse inaction. The storm continued
at intervals during the twenty-sixth, and, as
night approached, a strong wind, superadded to the
pelting rain, swept howling over the ridge, tearing many
of our tents from their uncertain moorings. All, however,
were disposed to view philosophically this somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
unceremonious welcome to the soil of Virginia,
and the hardships of a soldier’s life.</p>

<p>At noon of the twenty-seventh the order came to
strike tents, preparatory to moving our camp a few miles
up the Potomac. Late in the day the march began.
Crossing over into Georgetown, by the Aqueduct
Bridge, and following the picturesque course of the
river up to Chain Bridge, we return to the left bank,
and bivouack for the rest of the night around huge fires.
The next morning Camp Tuttle assumes a veritable existence,
and here the Twenty-seventh settle down to a
month’s routine and drill, preliminary to the rough experience
of an actual campaign. Our camp was situated
upon a rising ground, from which could be seen the majestic
dome of the Capitol. Some distance in front of
the parade, and on the left, were thick woods, while the
right was skirted by a road, across which were encamped
the Twenty-fourth and Twenty-eighth New-Jersey, and
the One Hundred and Twenty-seventh Pennsylvania,
which, with our own regiment, constituted a brigade of
Abercrombie’s division of the army, for the defence of
Washington. As soon as the camp was established in
its new location, the Colonel issued a regimental order,
setting forth the programme of daily duty as follows:
Reveille at six <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>; guard mounting at eight; company
drill from nine to eleven, and again from one
to two; battalion drill from three to four, and dress parade
at five <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>; tattoo at nine, taps at half-past nine.
All this was varied by an occasional season of picket
duty, a few miles up the Leesburg turnpike.</p>

<p>Our first Sabbath at Camp Tuttle forms, in most respects,
a sample of all the rest. Sunday is to the soldier
the most anomalous day of the calendar, especially if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
situated, as we were, without a chaplain. The weekly
inspection and freedom from drill are the chief points
which distinguish it from other days. In the present
instance, however, an unexpected cause of excitement
appeared. After dress parade, it was announced that in
consequence of certain rumored movements of the enemy
in the direction of Leesburg, it might be necessary to
beat the long roll, to call the regiment under arms at
any moment during the night. Of course, the very
thought of a rebel added new zest to our military existence.
Every one was on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui vive</i>, and made his arrangements
to respond to the call with the utmost
promptness. But the apprehended raid did not take
place, and our rest was therefore undisturbed by the
soul-stirring notes of the long roll.</p>

<p>Every few days a company was detailed to go on
picket&mdash;an event not altogether unwelcome, as a relief to
the monotonous round of camp duties, and as an introduction
to a new phase of experience. To obtain some
idea of this portion of our regimental life around Washington,
let us “fall in,” fully armed and equipped, and
follow one of these parties to the picket-line. On the
present occasion, Company H, with detachments from
other regiments, started out one morning, and, after
marching several miles on the Leesburg Turnpike, arrived
about ten o’clock at the village of Langley. The
line of pickets extended along the main road a short distance
beyond the centre of the place, and also along a
cross-road, which, coming up from the south, connects
with the turnpike just before we reach the village.
Houses, favorably situated at different points, were occupied
as headquarters of the various squads, or, if such
conveniences were not at hand, brush huts supplied their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
place. At that time Langley consisted of about a dozen
houses, and one small church, and had once been favored
with two regular taverns, whose sphere was now filled
by two boarding-houses of minor importance, one of
which indicated its character to the public by the sign:</p>

<div class="p2 center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="25%" summary="">
<tr><td class="bl bt">&nbsp;</td><td class="br bt">&nbsp;</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl bl"></td><td class="tdl br pad4">ANT &nbsp; &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="bl bb">&nbsp;</td><td class="br bb">&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p class="p2" />

<p class="noindent">The dinner hour having arrived, the pickets unanimously
conclude to set aside Uncle Sam’s homely fare, and take
advantage of the enlarged facilities of entertainment afforded
by the village. Accordingly they adjourn to one
of the boarding-houses, kept by a man of secession proclivities,
whose principles, however, do not interfere
with his untiring efforts to please. Such houses of refreshment,
where a civilized meal could be obtained, situated
as they were here and there along the picket-line,
added much to the enjoyment of these brief excursions
from camp. Our duties were not very onerous, requiring
the attention of each man two hours out of every
six, and consisted in seeing that no one passed along the
road, or appeared in the vicinity, without proper authority.
In good weather, the two days of picket duty, occurring
once a fortnight, were quite agreeable; but if
stormy, they afforded good material for the grumbling
fraternity.</p>

<p>In view of the approach of winter, and the probability
of remaining in our present location for some time,
it was thought best to make corresponding preparations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Pine logs, with considerable labor, were cut and brought
in from the neighboring forest, and soon Camp Tuttle
began to present an air of comfort positively inviting.
But after only a brief enjoyment of our improved quarters,
and as if to remind us of the uncertainty always
attending the soldier’s life, orders came, November
eighteenth, for Company H to strike tents, pack up, and
march over to Hall’s Hill, there to clear up a place for
the regimental encampment. Arriving on the hill in a
pelting rain, huge fires were built of the brush and
stumps which covered the ground, and by evening our
tents were up, and we were as comfortable as circumstances
would allow. Hearing of several deserted encampments
about a mile distant, on Miner’s and Upton’s
Hills, many parties went out the next morning to secure
anything which might add to their convenience. A
large barren plain was covered far and wide with the
huts and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> of a portion of McClellan’s army, which
encamped here in the winter of 1862. The whole presented
a very curious and suggestive sight. Meanwhile,
orders came to strike tents and rejoin the regiment.
It appeared that all the regiments in the vicinity
were ordered to prepare for a rapid march. The Army
of the Potomac had but recently crossed the river, after
the battle of Antietam, in pursuit of Lee, and the enemy
were said to be threatening General Sigel, in command
at Centreville. In view of this state of affairs, the reserve,
in the defences of Washington, was called upon
to be ready for any emergency. Returning to camp,
we found the men earnestly canvassing the nature of the
contemplated march. The orders, however, were countermanded
in the evening, perhaps in consequence of a
severe storm, which continued for several days.</p>

<span class="fs60 lsp3">TO THE FRONT.</span></h2>


<p>The soldier who is untried in the fearful ordeal of
war looks forward with a kind of adventurous excitement
to the time when he shall cross swords with the
enemy; and especially if his heart is bound up in the
cause, and his motives lie deeper than mere love of adventure,
he desires to stand at the post of duty, though
it be in the deadly charge, and at the cannon’s mouth.</p>

<p>At length the last day of November, a beautiful Sabbath,
came, and with it marching orders. All attention
was now concentrated upon the movement to take place
the next day, at nine o’clock. The cooks were busy preparing
rations for the march; the men were arranging
their traps in the most portable form, and all looked forward
with eager interest to the new scenes before us.
At the appointed time, on the following morning, the
Twenty-seventh, with the other regiments in the brigade,
began the march for Washington, leaving our comparatively
commodious A tents standing. Henceforth,
shelter-tents, and for much of the time no tents at all,
were to be our covering. Our final destination was all
a mystery, until, as the days advanced, conjecture was
enabled, with some probability, to fix upon Fredericksburg.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
The march across Chain Bridge, through
Georgetown and Washington, and down the Potomac,
fifteen miles, consumed the first day, and that night a
tired set slept beneath their shelter-tents, nestling in the
woods by the road-side.</p>

<p>By eight o’clock, December second, we were again in
motion, and before sundown accomplished the appointed
distance of twenty miles, through a pleasant country,
divided into large and apparently well-cultivated plantations.
Sambo’s glittering ivory and staring eyes gleamed
from many gateways, greeting us half suspiciously.
One young colored boy concluded he had been beaten
quite long enough by his master, and not liking the prospect
before him if he remained in slavery, thought best
to join the column, and march to freedom. In anticipation
of some such proceedings on the part of the colored
population, the planters of that region patrolled the
roads on horseback, watching our ranks as we filed past,
to see if some luckless contraband were not harbored
therein.</p>

<p>The third day brought us within three miles of Port
Tobacco, and without standing on ceremony, we encamped
for the night on the grounds of a secessionist
planter, and availed ourselves of his abundant store of
hay and straw. December fourth, we passed through
the town&mdash;a very ordinary, shabby-looking place, whose
secession population hardly deigned to glance at us,
except from behind closed shutters.</p>

<p>Thus far the weather had been delightful, but the fifth
day of our march, and the last on the Maryland side of
the Potomac, opened rather inauspiciously, and by the
time we reached the river bank at Liverpool Point, a
cold rain-storm had set in, in which we were obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
stand a couple of hours awaiting our turn to be ferried
across to Acquia Landing. At length the rain changed into
driving snow, and when we arrived at the Landing, the
surrounding hills were white with the generous deposit.
The village at Acquia Creek, after being evacuated sundry
times, had risen again from the ashes of several
burnings to become the base of supplies for Burnside’s
army before Fredericksburg. Busy carpenters were
rearing storehouses, eventually to take their turn at conflagration,
and the offing was full of vessels of every description,
loaded with stores to be transferred by rail to
Falmouth.</p>

<p>In the snow we disembarked, and after many delays
reached our camping ground, on a hill-side, a mile or
more up the railroad. It was now evening, and the
prospect seemed anything but encouraging, in view of
the fact that the storm continued with even augmented
fury. We pitched our shelter-tents and made our beds
in the snow, and built fires, under difficulties which can
hardly be exaggerated. To add to the discomfort of the
case, our supplies were entirely exhausted, and although
the wharves and storehouses at the Landing fairly groaned
with pork and hard-tack, we could not obtain these
articles, owing to inflexible red tape, and in part to the
fact that the railroad was monopolized in carrying subsistence
for the army at Falmouth. A very limited supply
of sawdust ginger-cakes constituted the universal
bill of fare until the evening of the next day.</p>

<p>December sixth dawned upon us, cold and frosty, but
clear&mdash;just such weather as graces the month in the
latitude of New-England. The discomforts of the preceding
day were soon forgotten in the cheerful sunshine.
At this time our worthy chaplain, Rev. J. W. Leek,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
joined the regiment. Though separated from us in one
short week, by reason of an almost fatal wound, yet in
that brief period he had gained the hearty respect and
esteem of all, and connected his name most honorably
with the history of the Twenty-seventh.</p>

<p>After a rest of two days, we bade adieu to Acquia
Creek on the morning of December eighth, and resumed
our march to Falmouth. Having lost our way, the journey,
which properly required but one day, occupied
until noon of the next, when we arrived at the headquarters
of General D. N. Couch, at that time in command
of the Second Army Corps. By him the Twenty-seventh
was assigned to the Third Brigade, General S. K. Zook’s,
of the First Division, commanded by General W. S.
Hancock. At this time the Army of the Potomac was
divided into three grand divisions&mdash;the right, left, and
centre&mdash;the first, of which our corps formed a part, under
the command of General Edwin V. Sumner.</p>

<p>We were now marched off to our camping ground, a
short distance from the Rappahannock river. Henceforth
the fortunes of the Twenty-seventh are linked with
the Army of the Potomac. The regiment belonged to a
corps whose thinned ranks eloquently testified to the
hard-fought contests of the Peninsula, where it had borne
the brunt, always in the fore-front of battle, and the last
to retire when retreat became necessary. The history
of the Second proved it to be one of the most reliable
corps in the service&mdash;always ready for any desperate
encounter under its brave and fighting leaders. The
famous Irish Brigade formed a part of our division.
Such being the character and history of the corps, it was
evident that the Twenty-seventh must now make up its
mind to the severest of campaign service. Scarcely were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
our tents up, when the Colonel received orders to have
the company cooks prepare four days’ rations, to be ready
by the next morning&mdash;the inevitable preliminary to more
important events.</p>

<p>The forenoon of December tenth was occupied in cleaning
our arms and preparing for an inspection, to take
place at twelve o’clock, before General Zook and staff.
Perhaps at this point it might be well to speak of the
weapons the General was called upon to inspect, and
which he declared unfit for service. One of his staff, a
day or two later, remarked: “Boys, if you can’t discharge
them, you can use the bayonet.” That certainly
was the most serviceable part of the gun. At the outset,
the Twenty-seventh, with the exception of the flank
companies, was furnished with Austrian rifles of such an
inferior order that no regular inspector would have
passed them. Scarcely one of these weapons was without
defects in the most essential particulars. These facts
are not mentioned to bring discredit upon any of the
authorities cognizant of such matters, but simply as a
matter of justice to the regiment. Doubtless the best of
reasons could have been given to justify the temporary
distribution of such arms. Early, however, in the following
January, the regiment was supplied with the
Whitney rifled musket, a weapon in the highest degree
satisfactory to all.</p>

<span class="fs60 lsp3">FREDERICKSBURG.</span></h2>


<p>In the afternoon of the tenth, two hundred and fifty
men of the Twenty-seventh were detailed to picket along
the Rappahannock above Falmouth. During all the following
night might be heard an unusual rumbling of
cars, bringing up subsistence from Acquia Creek, and the
rattling of ammunition wagons and pontoon trains, slowly
moving to their respective destinations. At half-past
four, on the morning of the eleventh, the Colonel
passed around to the officers’ quarters, giving orders to
have their companies supplied with three days’ rations,
and fall in by half-past six, in light marching order.
Let us leave the scene of busy preparation in camp, and
for a few moments view the events transpiring on the
river. Three points had been carefully selected by General
Burnside where bridges were to be thrown across&mdash;one
a short distance above the Lacey House, another a
few rods below the railroad bridge, and the third about
two miles below the city. Boat after boat is anchored
in its place; plank after plank is laid in quick succession,
and the river is well-nigh spanned by the trembling
structure, when suddenly two signal guns break on the
still night air, and a sheet of flame bursts from houses on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the opposite bank, where hundreds of sharp-shooters lie
concealed. The defenceless bridge builders are temporarily
driven from their work, while the cannon from the
bluffs behind belch forth a defiant response to the rebel
challenge.</p>

<p>To return to the Twenty-seventh. Promptly at half-past
six the regiment fell in and joined the rest of the
brigade, a short distance from camp. Silently, through
woods and across fields, we marched to the corps rendezvous,
in a deep hollow near the Phillips House, where
General Sumner had his headquarters. On the way we
passed long lines of troops moving rapidly to the river,
or resting behind rows of musket stacks. Here we were
to remain until a crossing could be effected.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the frequency of cannon discharges increases.
Every moment another adds its voice to the
swelling volume, until from twenty batteries, comprising
more than a hundred guns, arranged along the banks of
the river, bursts a tempest of shot and shell over the rebel
city. This continues, with little cessation, until noon. For
three hours following, only occasionally a gun disturbs
the comparative quiet. Then the ball opens again with
renewed violence. A visit to the top of the hill, overlooking
the city, reveals columns of smoke, with now and
then a flash of flame, testifying to the effectiveness of the
bombardment. At the river, all attempts to complete
the pontoon bridge had hitherto failed.</p>

<p>With particular interest we gazed upon a regiment of
the corps, as, tired, dusty, and powder smeared, it rejoined
us after a protracted effort at the bridge. History
records but few parallels to the more than heroic
valor which crowned that day’s work. A trusty weapon
supports the soldier’s courage, but to stand, unarmed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the target of unerring sharp-shooters, unable to respond
to their attacks, and in view of almost inevitable death,
is the highest test of courage. It became evident that
the bridge could be completed only by driving the sharp-shooters
from the houses on the opposite side, by a sudden
dash across the river. This hazardous duty was
intrusted to the Seventh Michigan and detachments from
several other regiments, and nobly was it performed.
The rebels were driven from their hiding-places, the
bridge touched the opposite shore, and the first act in
this fearful drama closed. This success was received
with universal joy, and all attention now concentrated in
what the future should unfold. General Howard’s division
of the Second Corps crossed over into the city, while
Hancock’s and French’s bivouacked for the night in a
strip of woods near the Phillips House.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, December twelfth, we crossed
into Fredericksburg, over the bridge which had cost so
much blood and labor the preceding day. Evidences of
the bombardment everywhere presented themselves, in
the houses perforated with shot and shell, and in the miscellaneous
rubbish which hindered our progress through
the street. Mattresses, pitchers, chairs, kitchen utensils,
and other furniture, scattered about in grotesque confusion,
testified that those who had passed the night in the
town had availed themselves of all the comforts within
reach. We moved down Water street, and halted at
the first pontoon bridge, a few rods below the railroad,
where we encamped that day and night. The Twenty-seventh
spent the day in bridging gullies and mud-holes
with boards and planks from neighboring fences, so that
the artillery could pass. Company B was detailed to lay
pontoons across a stream uniting with the Rappahannock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
just below the town. About the middle of the afternoon
the rebel batteries attempted to annoy the men
engaged in these preparations, and for a time a very
brisk artillery duel was maintained between the opposing
forces. Sheltered as we were by the steep bank, the
rebels could not obtain accurate range, and most of the
shells shrieked harmlessly over our heads, and fell into
the river or struck on the opposite side.</p>

<p>At length the eventful thirteenth arrived&mdash;a day full
of scenes and experiences which will never fade from the
memory of those who participated in them. Immediately
after breakfast we were marched up to Caroline
street, the principal street of the town, parallel with the
river. Here the division was formed in line of battle,
and stacked arms, while arrangements were being completed
to storm the heights back of the city. Staff officers
were riding in hot haste to and fro, carrying orders,
or disposing the forces, and occasionally our division
general, Hancock, rode slowly and proudly up and down
the line, surveying the ranks, his countenance wearing
an aspect of quiet and cool determination. At length
the sound of cannonading comes to our ears from below,
indicating that General Franklin has entered upon the
task assigned him, of seizing the railroad and turning the
enemy’s flank. Like banks of keys in a great organ, the
rebel works rise behind the town, and gradually the
chorus of notes bursts forth directly in front of us. The
rebel shell crash among the houses or strike in the street,
while the batteries of the Second Corps, on the north
bank of the Rappahannock, send their shrieking replies
over the city. “Attention!” rings out loud and long
above the din. Every man is in his place, his musket at
a shoulder. “Right face!” “Right shoulder shift arms!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
follow in quick succession. At this moment General
Hancock rides up to the Twenty-seventh, and leaning
forward in his saddle, with his right arm upraised, briefly
addresses them: “You are the only Connecticut regiment
in my division. Bring no dishonor upon the State
you represent.” The order is given, “Forward! March!”
reëchoed by commanders of brigades, regiments, and
companies, and we move in quick time down the street
to the railroad.</p>

<p>While the column is moving on, let us briefly survey
the position of the battle-field. Fredericksburg is situated
in a large amphitheatre, admirably adapted for
defence. Directly in the rear of the town is a smooth
field with a slightly ascending grade, extending back a
little less than half a mile to the telegraph road, which is
flanked by a stone wall, beyond which rises a ridge somewhat
abruptly from a hundred to a hundred and fifty
feet high. This range of high ground extends as far as
Hazel Run, a little stream emptying into the Rappahannock
just below the lower edge of the town, and in the
other direction bends toward the river, which it very
nearly touches just above Falmouth, about a mile above
Fredericksburg. Rebel batteries were strongly posted
along this eminence, so that a front and enfilading fire
could be secured upon any force advancing across the
level plateau. General Longstreet was in command of
these lines of fortifications, while Stonewall Jackson
commanded the rebel right, opposite General Franklin,
the whole under the supreme direction of General Lee.
Bearing in mind that the task before us was to capture
these formidable heights, let us return to the storming
column.</p>

<p>Sheltered in a measure by the houses, it passes down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Caroline street with little interruption; but as soon as
we arrived at the railroad dépôt, several rebel guns,
trained upon the spot with fatal accuracy, welcome us
to the encounter. Very near this point fell Captain
Schweizer, the first of the long list of casualties which
at nightfall told how fearfully the conflict had decimated
the ranks of the Twenty-seventh. Several were knocked
down, one of whom, leaping up, exclaimed earnestly,
“I’ll have pay for that!” then springing to his place,
rushed on to death, for no one ever saw or heard of him
afterward. The division now advanced at a double-quick
into the open field; then, after resting a few moments
on the ground, at the order, “Charge!” moved
by the left flank with fixed bayonets, passing French’s
division, which had been obliged to fall back. A second
brief rest, then on again, while shot and shell plow the
ground in front, burst over our heads, or make fearful
gaps in the line. Yet on we rush. The wounded are
left where they fall. Not a word is spoken, not a gun
fired. As we approach nearer the rebel lines, all the
elements of destruction ingenuity can devise or position
afford, are concentrated upon the narrow space. From
rows of rifle-pits, protected by a heavy stone wall, bursts
a continuous roll of musketry; from neighboring houses
flashes the deadly fire of sharp-shooters, while batteries
posted on the heights behind strong field-works, and supported
by infantry, sweep the field with shot and shell
and grape and canister. Enfilading batteries on the
right and left of the rebel semicircle pour in their swift
discharges, and behind us, the batteries of the Second
Corps, on the other side of the river, shell the enemy’s
works with little effect at the distance of nearly three
thousand yards, but with so much danger to the storming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
party, that General Couch orders them to cease
firing. The line now begins to waver, and, with some
disorder, presses forward to a brick house, from which
a brisk musketry fire is kept up in the direction of the
stone wall. At this time the various regiments became
mingled together, and, unfortunately, at the order to
deploy into line to renew the charge, the Twenty-seventh,
in consequence of the confusion, separated into several
fragments, advancing to the right and left of the house.
The time for a sudden dash had passed, and unable
longer to stem the avalanche of fire, which seemed to
gather intensity as we proceeded, the charge was continued
only as far as a board fence, all full of bullet holes
and torn with shot, less than a hundred yards from the
famous stone wall, as estimated by an officer of the regiment
who afterward visited the spot under flag of truce.
With the exception of a partially successful attempt to
approach still nearer the rebel rifle-pits, the men remained
at this point the rest of the afternoon, loading their
guns on the ground, then rising sufficiently to deliver
their fire.</p>

<p>The rebel musketry continued with almost uninterrupted
violence until night overshadowed the scene,
never entirely ceasing in our front. At times it surged
off to another part of the line, with only a scattering fire
opposite our position; then rolled back again with redoubled
power, the peculiar rattling of separate discharges
being fused into one prolonged sound. Lines
of rebel troops could be seen marching along the ridge,
and running down to aid their comrades in the rifle-pits
below. But for a weary two hours no reënforcement advanced
to the support of the Union forces. At one time
appearances seemed to indicate that the rebels were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
about to charge upon our feeble line, but a few well-directed
volleys admonished them to remain behind
their stone walls.</p>

<p>The Union artillery had thus far accomplished comparatively
little, owing to its distance from the rebel
works, and to the absence of all favorable positions
where guns could be posted, on the Fredericksburg
side of the river. Late in the afternoon, however, several
guns took position in the upper streets of the city.
The battle-field shook with their combined discharge.
Meanwhile Hancock’s division had been mostly withdrawn,
to give place to the other division of the Second
Corps. But many of the Twenty-seventh and other
regiments remained at their posts, their safety being
still more endangered if they attempted to leave the
field.</p>

<p>At three o’clock in the afternoon, Howard’s division
advanced to the attack, to be hurled back before the
overwhelming fire of the rebels. Only a brief time is
now left before darkness will cover the scene. A final,
desperate effort must be made to take the heights. Supported
by the batteries in the streets, a fresh division
advances into the field. How splendidly they charge!
with what a perfect line! We can look into the faces
of the men as they come on. Nothing apparently can
withstand their onset. They come steadily to within a
few paces of where we lie. Then bursts forth from the
rebel works an iron tempest which had scarcely a parallel
even on that day. Showers of bullets went whistling
by or struck the ground in every direction, while
pieces of shell, bits of old iron, grape and canister,
rained down with a dull sound as they hit the earth.
Arrested in its course, the line wavers, fires a few volleys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
then scatters like chaff. It was now about dusk,
and many of the Twenty-seventh who had remained on
the field after the withdrawal of our division, retired
into the city. At the edge of the plateau, where a battery
was stationed, mounted officers were endeavoring
to rally into some sort of order the shattered remnants
of the division, whose magnificent charge we have just
described.</p>

<p>The aspect of Fredericksburg that night cannot be
adequately described. Lines of troops were under arms
in the streets, ready to meet the enemy should they attempt
to follow up their advantage and drive the army
across the river. Crowds of soldiers, all excited by the
events of the day, moved rapidly along the sidewalks.
Processions of stretcher bearers tenderly conveyed their
mangled freight to the hospitals. The eloquent red flag
waved from almost every house, suggesting that the
surgeons were diligently at work, while the glare of
candles from the windows added to the wildness of the
scene without.</p>

<p>The next day was the Sabbath, bright and clear overhead,
but inexpressibly sad to us; for one third of the
three hundred and seventy-five who followed the colors
of the Twenty-seventh into battle, lay dead on the field,
or wounded in the hospital. That forenoon was spent
in cleaning our guns, in anticipation of further fighting.
The Connecticut Brigade, under General Harland, was
drawn up in line of battle on the main street, under
orders to be ready at any moment to charge up the
heights. As will subsequently appear, they were spared
this perilous duty. Occasionally a resident of the town
came timidly forth from his hiding-place, or a family,
loaded down with bundles of household effects, slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
wended their way across the pontoon bridge, to escape
the terrors surrounding them. A disagreeable uncertainty
hung over every moment of the day, and when
we awoke on the morning of the fifteenth, nothing had
transpired to diminish our suspense. It was plain that
something must be done, and that very soon. Delay
only added to the difficulties of the situation. The army
must fight, or evacuate the city. Every few minutes
during the day we were ordered to fall in. The expectation
was universal that we were again to be led to
the attack. Hour after hour processions of ambulances
moved across the pontoon bridge, and up the opposite
bank, so that by evening the town was nearly empty
of the wounded. General Burnside rode by and received
a hearty welcome. Evidently a movement of
some kind was soon to be made. A short time after
dark the division was ordered under arms, and all, except
the Twenty-seventh Connecticut, marched down
Water street toward the railway bridge. Our little
band stood waiting thus during the evening, in momentary
expectation of being led out to support the
pickets. At length orders were received to advance a
few hundred yards below the railroad. As we arrived,
the rest of the brigade silently arose from the ground
where they had been sleeping, and like spectres vanished
in the darkness. Here we remained until near midnight,
obtaining what sleep was possible, then noiselessly fell
in, and without a word spoken above a whisper, retired
rapidly down the street to the pontoon bridge. The
streets were as silent as death. A few soldiers were
preparing to loosen the moorings which held the pontoons
to the banks. After a brief halt, the Twenty-seventh,
carrying a few boxes of ammunition, re-crossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the river by the same bridge on which they had entered
the city four days before. On the road to Falmouth we
met General Hancock, who asked, “What regiment is
this?” and being informed, the Twenty-seventh Connecticut,
expressed his great satisfaction with the conduct
of the regiment in the events of the last few days.
After losing our way in the darkness, and experiencing
a heavy rain-storm, we arrived at our old camp ground
on the morning of the sixteenth.</p>

<p>All unconscious of the night’s events, the rebels threw
a few shells into the town, and meeting no response, crept
cautiously down from their fortifications, expecting to
find our forces concealed under the banks of the river.
But no pickets challenged their advance: the Union
army had slipped from their grasp, the pontoons were
up, and thus was accomplished one of the most skilful

<span class="fs60 lsp3">CAMP NEAR FALMOUTH.</span></h2>


<p>The failure at Fredericksburg, considered in itself,
and especially in connection with its causes, was well
calculated to produce much discouragement throughout
the entire army. On the eleventh of December the
troops streamed forth from their camps, confident in
their ability to drive the foe from Marye’s Heights, and
hurl him back to Richmond. On the sixteenth they returned,
baffled and dispirited, having lost twelve thousand
men in fruitless efforts to overcome the natural and
artificial advantages of the rebel position. The fearful
scenes of a battle may well impress the veteran of many
conflicts; but when, for the first time, a regiment meets
the enemy with every advantage in favor of the latter,
and when the list of killed and wounded swells to unusual
proportions, and nothing is accomplished by this
expense of life and energy, it is no sign of weakness that
despondency and gloom for a time prevail. Such a feeling,
resulting from failure in the campaign, and from the
loss of a large number of our most esteemed officers and
men, pervaded the Twenty-seventh in common with the
rest of the army. The loss of such men as Captains
Schweizer and Taylor, Sergeants Barrett and Fowler,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Corporals Mimmac and Alling, and many others, men of
high character, who went to the field purely from a
sense of duty&mdash;such men in their death could not fail to
leave behind, among their fellow soldiers, a universal
sorrow, reaching to the very depths of the heart. The
memory of those who fell on the thirteenth of December,
and many of whom lie in unknown graves back of Fredericksburg,
will never lose its freshness, but rather grow
in strength as the history of future years adds significance
to the conflicts of the present.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the success of Burnside’s plan of
evacuation, his operations were concealed in the darkness
of a severe storm, which had not terminated when
we arrived in our former camp on the morning of the
sixteenth. In the afternoon the two hundred and fifty
men of the Twenty-seventh who had been picketing
along the Rappahannock for the previous six days, rejoined
us, many of them much exhausted by their unusually
prolonged duties. Expecting to be absent from
the regiment only a day, the ordinary limit of picket
duty at one time, the party took with them only one
day’s rations, and in the confusion attending the movement
of troops and the battle, rations for the additional
time could be procured but irregularly and in insufficient
quantities.</p>

<p>According to orders, the camp was now moved to a
strip of pine woods skirting the west side of the division
parade-ground. But this was not to be our permanent
location; and after manœuvring for several days from
one place to another, we at length encamped in the edge
of a forest, only a few rods from where we first pitched
our tents, on the line of the Rappahannock. An elevated
plain stretched away between us and the river, and above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
a slight depression the clustered spires of Fredericksburg
rose to view, from whose belfreys, on a Sabbath
morning, we could sometimes hear the summons to the
house of God. A walk of a few rods brought us in full
view of the city, sitting in calm quiet among the hills,
while long red lines told where the rebel earthworks
lay, and little specks of white in the background disclosed
the enemy’s camps. Just under the edge of the
bluff to our right, and concealed from view, was the
village of Falmouth, a mongrel collection of houses arranged
along dirty, unpaved streets.</p>

<p>Although intimations were thrown out that the army
would now go into winter quarters, yet it was nearly two
weeks before our men could dispossess themselves of the
idea that some fine morning the old stereotyped order,
“Strike tents and pack knapsacks!” would scatter to
the winds their plans of personal comfort.</p>

<p>As soon as it was evident that no further movements
would be made, the men vigorously applied themselves
to the work of building huts, devoting the mornings to
this labor, while brigade drill occupied the afternoon.
In the hundred and thirty log houses of our little regimental
village was embraced an amount of comfort
wholly inconceivable by those who know nothing of the
numerous contrivances a soldier’s ingenuity can suggest
to supply the place of ordinary conveniences. Generally,
four congenial minds would unite their mechanical
resources. A pine forest within reasonable distance, an
axe and a shovel, one of Uncle Sam’s mule teams, and a
moderate degree of ingenuity, constitute the only capital
of these camp carpenters. Having secured a favorable
site, ten by seven, these comrades in bunk sally
forth to the neighboring grove, and before their sturdy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
blows the old pines come crashing down, are split into
slabs of the required length, and in due time reach their
destination in camp. After smoothing the ground, and
carefully removing stumps, the logs are hewn out and
placed one above another, with the ends dove-tailed together,
or set upright side by side in trenches, and soon
the huts assume their full proportions&mdash;seven feet by
ten. Every man now becomes a mason. The surrounding
region is ransacked for stone and brick, with which
to construct a fire-place at the front end. While this
important work is going on, another is vigorously plying
his wooden trowel, in plastering up the fissures with
clay, on the principle that nothing is without its use,
even Virginia mud. The roof is made of thin shelter-tents,
buttoned together. As regards internal arrangements,
at the further end are two bunks, one above the
other; and as the upholsterer has not performed his
part, and very likely never will, the occupants must content
themselves with the soft side of pine slabs. On one
side of the hut is a rack for the reception of guns and
equipments, while at the other a cracker-box cover on
stilts does duty as a table. In respect to seats, the ingenuity
of different individuals showed itself in rudely
constructed benches, or square boards, elevated on three-pronged
crotchets, obtained in the woods, or was satisfied
with the trunk of a tree cut into suitable lengths.
Over the fire-place a mantle was generally located, containing
a confused collection of tin plates and cups,
knives and forks, and an endless variety of rubbish. In
winter quarters it is very desirable to have a liberal supply
of culinary furniture. The man whose fire-place is
adorned with an iron frying-pan, is an object of envy to
all his comrades, and is universally agreed to have reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the acme of comfort. However, the halves of old
canteens, fitted with handles, answer very well in its
place. In many of the huts, telegraph wire might be
found doing service in the shape of a gridiron, upon
which an occasional steak is broiled. Very likely, in its
appropriate place is a coffee-pot, perhaps of the plantation
style, two feet high, and large in proportion, which
some argus-eyed soldier has observed and quietly confiscated.</p>

<p>Our huts were now nearly completed, and with no little
satisfaction we surveyed their rough architecture,
pork-barrel chimneys, and cracker-box doors, feeling that
though the winds might blow, and the rainy season pour
down its floods, we were prepared to endure it patiently.
When the army has just completed its preparations for
a comfortable time, it is safe to prophesy marching orders
within three days thereafter. So it proved in the
present instance. At dress parade, on the sixteenth of
January, an order was read for the regiment to be ready
to march on the next day with three days’ rations. Details
were dispatched at midnight to the Brigade Commissary’s,
after rations, and in good season on the seventeenth
we were ready to start; but no final orders came, and
it was bruited about that General J. E. B. Stuart, while
roving around Dumfries and Alexandria with his rebel
cavalry, in the absence of General Burnside in Washington,
had telegraphed an order, as if from him, for the
army to be ready to move. This is of a piece with a
joke Stuart perpetrated on another occasion, when in the
name of a Union General he telegraphed to Washington
for certain stores, and is reported to have received them
in good order.</p>

<p>On the eighteenth, Generals Burnside and Sumner reviewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
our Army Corps. In the afternoon of the twentieth,
an order was read, announcing that the army was
“about to meet the enemy once more. The auspicious
moment had arrived to strike a great and mortal blow
at the rebellion, and to gain that decisive victory due to
the country.” The plan was for Hooker and Franklin
to cross at Banks’s Ford, six miles above Falmouth, and
capture Taylor’s Hill, the key of the position, from
which they could advance in the rear of Fredericksburg,
and turn the enemy’s flank. This being done,
Sumner with his grand division, to which the Twenty-seventh
belonged, was to cross directly in front of the
city at the old place, and take the batteries which had
baffled our efforts in the battle of December thirteenth.
The plan was substantially the same as the previous one,
except that the flank movement was to be made upon
the rebel left wing instead of his right. The failure of
December resulted from the inefficiency of Franklin’s
flank demonstration, which allowed the enemy to mass
his forces in front of Sumner. But now it was proposed
to use two corps in the preliminary movement, and, provided
they were successful in taking Taylor’s Hill, Sumner’s
success would be assured, notwithstanding the rebels
had been engaged for a month previous in strengthening
and extending their works. Hooker and Franklin
were in motion on the twentieth, while impetuous Sumner
waited in his camps to hear the signal which should
summon his veteran legions to the conflict. For several
days, artillery and pontoons had been passing camp <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
route</i> for Banks’s Ford. If the weather continues favorable,
the morrow will bring to our ears the boom of a
hundred and fifty cannon.</p>

<p>But one of those strange events beyond man’s power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
to avert disconcerts the whole plan. Instead of the
roar of artillery, the unwelcome sound of rain salutes
our ears the next morning, and continues for several
days. Impassable roads, guns and pontoons fast in the
mud, men toiling slowly along, or pulling at the boats,
add a new page to the chapter of misfortune which had
followed the noble Army of the Potomac. The rebels
briefly summed up this last advance in these laconic
words, “Burnside stuck in the mud!” which they impudently
displayed from their picket-line, derisively inquiring
when the “auspicious moment” would arrive.
The rainy season had now set in in good earnest, and the
wearied troops returned to their camps to await the advent
of spring.</p>

<p>The progress of events had already foreshadowed a
change of commanders, and on the twenty-ninth of January
general orders were read announcing that General
Burnside had been relieved, and the accession of Joe
Hooker. The brief two months of Burnside’s command
had secured for him the sincere respect of the whole
army. His honesty of purpose could not be impeached,
and none felt more keenly than himself the ill success
which had attended him. History, in summing up his
campaign, will assign no small significance to the fact
that Burnside did not receive the hearty coöperation of
his subordinate commanders. He possessed an excessive
self-distrust, and it was creditable to his candor to confess
it; yet it is a question whether this distrust did
not reäct unfavorably upon the officers and men of his
command. Condemn it as we may, the boastful self-confidence
of Hooker had no little influence in reïnspiring
the army with that self-reliance which forms an important
item in the calculations of success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The advent of General Hooker was signalized by the
abolition of the grand divisions, and a return to the simpler
organization of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Corps d’Armée</i>. And what was of
more consequence to the soldiers, an order was published
directing the issue of four rations of fresh bread and
fresh beef, and two rations of potatoes per week, with
an occasional supply of other vegetables. This measure
went right to the hearts of the army, for it must be confessed,
and it is nothing to their disgrace, that the hearts
of soldiers are very near, if not actually in, their stomachs.
For an army is a great physical machine, expending
a vast amount of animal power, and requiring careful
attention to its animal wants to secure the highest
moral efficiency.</p>

<p>From the battle of Fredericksburg to Hooker’s move
in the spring of 1863, the Twenty-seventh was engaged
in picket duty along the Rappahannock, whose banks
are as familiar to the men almost as the walks of childhood.
Every other day, at seven in the morning, our
quota of the division picket, equipped with blankets and
one day’s rations, formed in front of the Colonel’s tent,
and, after inspection, marched a mile to General Hancock’s
headquarters to undergo another inspection, after
which a march of two or three miles brought them to
the line of the river. The fact that three fourths of the
time it was either rainy, or snowing, or cold and blustering,
will give some idea of the arduous character of
picket duty. By mutual agreement, the custom of
picket firing, so annoying and useless, was discontinued,
and friendly intercourse was no uncommon event; which
latter practice, though harmless in itself, was yet so liable
to make trouble that it was prohibited by special order.
Frequently the rebels launched out on the river their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
diminutive craft, laden with tobacco and the latest Richmond
papers, and bearing a note to “Gentlemen of the
United States,” requesting an interchange of commodities.</p>

<p>February twenty-second, we experienced the severest
snow-storm of the season. At noon, through the thick
mist of snow-flakes, came the deep boom of cannon, swelling
into a loud chorus, from the adjacent batteries, answered
by the low, muffled murmur of the distant discharge.
In every direction salutes were being fired in
honor of Washington’s birthday. The time and place
gave additional interest to this demonstration of respect
for the Father of his Country, for this region is intimately
connected with his history. Here he lived, and
here are his descendants to this day, while on the other
side of the Rappahannock a simple tomb marks his
mother’s resting-place.</p>

<p>March fifth, General Hooker reviewed the Second
Army Corps, on a large plain, near Hancock’s headquarters.
The corps was drawn up in nine lines by brigade,
in all nearly fifteen thousand men. General Hooker and
General Couch, the then corps commander, with their brilliant
and numerous staffs, rode rapidly up and down the
several lines, while the men presented arms. Then taking
position in front, the brigades marched by in column
by company. Nothing was more impressive than the
sight of the many regiments reduced to a mere fragment
of their former strength&mdash;a silently eloquent commentary
upon the inscriptions on their banners.</p>

<p>The rapid advance of spring, and Hooker’s known
determination to move on the enemy at the earliest possible
moment, led to much speculation as to the plan of
the new campaign. Before the close of March, intimations
were thrown out that the army must expect soon to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
take the field. Daily balloon ascensions were made at
several points on the river, in order to ascertain the position
of the rebels. As an illustration of “Fighting
Joe’s” cool assurance, it was currently reported that one
day he sent his balloon directly over the city of Fredericksburg,
having previously notified the commandant
that any molestation would meet with condign punishment
from his batteries. The comparative nearness of
our camp to the river afforded good opportunities for
observing any change on the rebel side, and the probability
that we should have to cross in front of the city in
any future movement, whetted our curiosity. The rebels
had been actively engaged all winter in strengthening
their position, and now dark lines of rifle-pits and
earthworks frowned from the bluffs for miles up and
down the banks, commanding every available crossing.
As may well be imagined, the prospect was by no means
inviting.</p>

<span class="fs60 lsp3">CHANCELLORSVILLE.</span></h2>


<p>April eighth, the Twenty-seventh participated in the
grand review of the Army of the Potomac by President
Lincoln, preparatory to opening the spring campaign.
Fifty or sixty thousand men were in line, and probably
the army was never in better condition than at that
time.</p>

<p>One week later, orders were received to supply the
men with eight days’ rations, five to be carried in
their knapsacks, and three in their haversacks. Overcoats,
dress coats, and everything which could possibly
be dispensed with, were to be turned in to the
Quartermaster. Each day company inspections were
held, to see that the men were prepared as the orders
directed. About this time the regiment was transferred
to the Fourth Brigade, under the command of Colonel
J. R. Brooke, of the Fifty-third Pennsylvania. A storm
of two days’ duration postponed the forward movement
a short time, but by the twenty-seventh of the
month the weather became tolerably settled, and now
began a campaign which it was fondly hoped would result
in the capture of Richmond. In the morning we
sent out an additional picket of over three hundred men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
leaving hardly a corporal’s guard in camp. All day
artillery and cavalry, pack-mules and wagon-trains, were
passing camp, on their way to the right. Late in the
evening, orders came to strike tents, pack up as quietly
as possible, and report on the division parade at daybreak.
Our pickets returned at two o’clock the next
morning. The camp was now full of bustling preparation.
The huts all illuminated; the eager hum of
voices; men hurrying to and fro; the decided tones of
command, combined to form a scene of excitement nowhere
found but in the army. At daybreak the regiment
fell in, and bade farewell to the dismantled camp,
to enter upon an experience none of us had ever contemplated
as likely to fall to our lot.</p>

<p>Camp near Falmouth will linger vividly in memory,
when other more startling scenes of army life have faded
into oblivion. Our four months’ residence witnessed a
complete change in the face of the country. A few
stumps, or a solitary tree, were all that was left of the
forests which, four months before, waved over a hundred
square miles of territory. Here and there a house,
tenantless, fenceless, and dingy, or a blackened ruin,
with only a bare chimney standing, loomed above the
naked landscape, a picture of complete desolation.</p>

<p>The division having assembled near General Hancock’s
headquarters, began the march for United States Ford,
at seven in the morning. We passed many deserted
encampments, whose late occupants, like ourselves, were
on the move. Instead of following the direct course of
the river up to the Ford, which was only ten miles
above Falmouth, we pursued a very circuitous route,
and, after an easy march, halted in a strip of woods,
where we encamped for the night. The next day, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
evening, we had just pitched our tents and built fires,
and were in the act of making coffee, and frying a bit
of pork or beef, when the order came for the Twenty-seventh
to fall in with all possible dispatch. Suppers
were thrust into haversacks, without much regard to
order, and in a few moments the regiment marched off
about a mile, to picket in the woods. This duty occupied
us until the next afternoon, when we were relieved,
and hastened on to overtake the rest of the brigade,
which had already broken camp. During the night
previous a light fall of rain took place, just enough,
however, to put the roads in bad condition. All along
the route, pioneers were thrown out in advance, to corduroy
the worst places for the passage of the trains.
As far as the eye could reach, a continuous line of army
wagons filled the road, urging their way forward with
the greatest difficulty. The woods on either hand rang
with the sharp crack of the teamsters’ whips, and simultaneously
a chorus of wild shouts burst from the driver
and the men pushing at the wheels, while high above
the din rose shrill cries, resembling the notes of the
screech-owl. Then, with a quick, jerking jump, the
nimble mules landed the team in the next rut, to await
the reception of the same magical sounds.</p>

<p>Advancing to within a short distance of the Ford, the
corps halted to await the completion of the preparations
for crossing. The sun now burst forth from the canopy
of clouds as if in glad sympathy with the exhilaration
which pervaded all hearts in consequence of the encouraging
news from the front. A dispatch from General
Hooker announced that the success of the Fifth,
Eleventh, and Twelfth Corps was all that could be
desired, and that the rebels were retiring. These corps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
broke camp early on Monday morning, April twenty-seventh,
and took the route to Kelly’s Ford, twenty-five
miles above Fredericksburg. The pontoons were
laid and a crossing effected on the following day, with
very little opposition, and the troops pushed forward
rapidly to Germania Ford, on the Rapidan, for the
purpose of concentrating at Chancellorsville. General
Stoneman, with his cavalry, crossed on Wednesday, to
enter upon the grand raid which the <cite>Richmond Examiner</cite>
characterized as the “most audacious enterprise
of the war.” The diversion from Germania caused the
rebels to evacuate their works in front of the United
States Ford, so that no molestation was offered when the
pontoons were laid for the passage of the Second Corps.
Late in the afternoon of April thirtieth, we moved
rapidly down the abrupt, woody bank, and once more,
set foot on the south side of the Rappahannock. A
line of well-constructed rifle-pits, with more elaborate
works for cannon, at intervals of several hundred yards,
commanded the crossing. In their hasty retreat the
rebels left behind two pieces of artillery spiked. Only
a few miles now separated us from the scene of operations,
and after marching through woods, and over
muddy roads, rendered infinitely worse by the constant
passage of troops, we bivouacked for the night a short
distance from the Chancellor House, a large brick mansion,
so called from its occupant, V. Chancellor. This residence
was situated about five miles from United States
Ford, and about ten miles southwest of Fredericksburg,
at the junction of the plank road to Gordonsville and
the Orange County turnpike. A shapeless mass of ruins
is all that now remains of what gave name to one of the
most remarkable battles of the war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Save an occasional discharge of cannon, the forenoon
of May first was spent in comparative quiet, neither
party seeming disposed to inaugurate the conflict.
Movements, however, were in progress with a view to
ascertain the enemy’s position. In the afternoon the
Twenty-seventh participated in a reconnoissance for this
purpose, which came very near proving an affair of no
little importance. Leaving our bivouack in the woods,
we advanced down the road by the Chancellor House,
and ascending a gentle elevation, turned aside into an
open lot on the left, near a small dwelling, afterward
occupied by General Lee as his headquarters. Here a
section of artillery was exchanging compliments in a
lively manner with a rebel battery, a short distance up
the road. Several companies were immediately deployed
as skirmishers, with the remainder as a support,
and advanced through the woods to feel the enemy’s
position, and develop his strength. Suddenly the artillery
limbered up, the skirmishers were called in, and the
reconnoitering force retired to the rear at double-quick.
This movement was rendered necessary by an advance of
the enemy, seriously threatening our right flank; but they
were foiled in the attempt, and fell back before a stubborn
fire of musketry and artillery. For a few moments
we remained in line of battle in the open ground near
the Chancellor House, then, moving down the road a
short distance, deployed through the thick and tangled
woods on the left. Appearances indicated that the rebels
were about to charge down from the ridge from which
we had just retired, but they contented themselves with
shelling us furiously with their batteries. Long before
the cannonade ceased, the mellow twilight of a May
evening had passed into the darkness of night, adding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
to the fearful sublimity of the scene, as the rebel guns
woke the sleeping forest echoes, and shells careered
wildly through the air, and crashed among the trees.
Quietly resting on the ground, we wait for the iron
storm to pass. No sooner has the last shell swept over
our heads and burst into numberless fragments, than we
enter upon the night’s work, of intrenching our position
against the anticipated attack of the morrow. The rebels
were apparently engaged in similar work just across the
ravine. It was a busy and exciting scene along the
lines of the army that night. The rapid strokes of axemen,
followed by the dull sound of falling trees, rang
through the woods in every direction. Details of men
were at hand to put the logs in position, while others
dug a trench in the rear, and heaped the soil upon them.
For some distance in front of the breastworks, trees
were cut down for the purpose of obstructing the enemy’s
advance. After the completion of our intrenchments,
we rested under arms, and at daybreak, May second, as
silently as possible, marched out into the road, and
past the Chancellor House, and took a new position in
Hooker’s line of battle. The rebels soon entered the
place we had just left, which, however, was of very
little value to them, and could easily be reöccupied
when circumstances required. We spent the forenoon
in building breastworks, while on the other parts of the
line there was much skirmishing, and several sharp
fights. At intervals during the day the enemy opened
upon us with shot and shell, discovering our position by
the smoke curling above the trees from the camp fires.
At noon, when rations were being dealt out to the companies,
the rebel gunners, doubtless tantalized by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
display, seemed determined to involve commissaries and
rations in one common ruin.</p>

<p>Several days had now passed in the usual preliminaries
to a battle. Hooker had succeeded in drawing
the main force of the rebels from their works in the rear
of Fredericksburg, and was himself well intrenched in
the dense woods skirting the plank road, and most appropriately
called the Wilderness. The line of battle of
the Union forces formed a broad wedge, whose base
rested on the Rappahannock, the apex terminating at
the extreme front beyond the Chancellor House. The
Eleventh Corps held the extreme right, and next in
order were the Third, Twelfth, and Second, while the
Fifth occupied the left.</p>

<p>Lee is said to have issued orders to his troops to break
this line, at all hazards. A brief calm followed the desultory
movements of the day. The men stood in their
places behind the breastworks, gazing into the woods in
front, eagerly listening to hear the first sound which
should tell where the rebel blow would strike. At four
o’clock in the afternoon, the enemy advanced in heavy
force down the plank road, and began the attack in the
neighborhood of the intrenchments we had thrown up
the night before. The rapid fire of musketry on our
right indicated a serious attempt to pierce the centre of
the Union line. Under cover of this movement, the indomitable
Jackson advanced his hordes through the
woods, and hurled their solid array on Hooker’s right
wing, directly in rear of our present position. Let the
Eleventh Corps stand firm, and victory will rest on our
banners ere the close of day. The current history of the
hour tells us how the crisis was met. But more expressive
than history itself was the wild shout of triumph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
that burst from one end of the rebel line to the other, as
it swept over the earthworks, and saw the panic-stricken
corps dashing madly to the rear. Who can describe the
almost breathless interest with which we listened to the
fluctuations of the conflict? Now the avalanche of the
enemy is stayed a moment in its course; then nearer and
nearer approaches the sound of battle, and it seems as if
the next instant the foe will dash in upon our rear. A
portion of the Second Corps hurries away to the scene
of strife, and General Hancock, every nerve strung to
the highest pitch of excitement, rides up to inform the
Colonel that probably we should not be called into
action, but were to hold our position, and that in case of
necessity we could fight on either side of our breastworks,
plainly pointing to the possibility that the enemy
may attack in the rear. Through the woods behind us
we can see batteries of artillery rushing into position
near Hooker’s headquarters, and in a few moments the
forest trembles with the terrific cannonade, vying with
the thunders of heaven in the compass of its sound. In
the distance the deep, prolonged boom of a hundred-pounder
swells the bass notes of the chorus. Double-shotted
with grape and canister, the field-pieces sweep
the rebel line with murderous effect. At length darkness
put an end to this sublime exhibition of human
power. The frightened whippoorwills ceased their
plaintive cries; the quiet moon rose over the bloody
field, and Nature sank into a silence fairly oppressive.
We remained under arms most of the night, frequently
changing our position as the emergency required.</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock occurred one of those episodes of
warfare which, in startling grandeur and terrible magnificence,
well-nigh border on the supernatural. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
forces of Hooker and Lee were resting on their arms,
renewing their energies with an hour of broken slumber,
and ready to rush to battle at the first flash of
dawn. The air was perfectly still and serene, transmitting
the rays of the moon with unusual brilliancy.
Scarcely a sound disturbed the painful silence of the
almost interminable woods. All at once the artillery,
massed on the ridge hardly half a mile behind us, with
one tremendous crash poured in its fire upon the enemy’s
position, covering the charge of a division of infantry.
The thunder of musketry and artillery reverberated
through the forest with an effect inconceivably grand.</p>

<p>At the earliest moment on Sabbath morning, May
third, the battle was renewed, but apparently with less
vigor than on the preceding day, and yet, as brigade
after brigade became engaged, and the almost unexampled
roar of musketry rolled along the line, it was evident
that the enemy were about to follow up, with even
greater desperation, the advantage already gained. Immediately
after breakfast, the Twenty-seventh, with the
exception of two companies&mdash;D and F, engaged in other
duty&mdash;was ordered down into the intrenchments we had
thrown up, near the apex of the wedge, the Friday night
previous. These works now formed a part of the picket-line
of the army, and from the nature of the position and
its relation to the movements of the enemy, a large force
was required in order to hold it. As is usual in such
cases, when a picket in force is ordered, the colors did
not accompany the column. As the regiment advanced,
at double-quick, down the hill into the ravine, it was met
by a heavy fire of musketry. A number were wounded,
and several shot through the head, just as they entered
the breastworks. One or two regiments whose ammunition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
was exhausted, were gradually drawn off in small
squads. Not succeeding in their first attempt, the rebels
made no further attack in force upon our part of the line,
but, concealed in the thick woods, continually annoyed
us with a scattering fire. The men replied as they had
opportunity, and with considerable effect, as the rebels
themselves afterward acknowledged. Colonel Bostwick
was particularly noticeable for the almost reckless exposure
of himself to the enemy’s fire, while attending to
his duties at different points in the line. Lieutenant-Colonel
Merwin reminded him several times of the great
danger he incurred, as he stood on a slightly rising
ground to the rear of the rifle-pits, a conspicuous object
for some rebel bullet.</p>

<p>While the conflict was culminating in other parts of
the field, the enemy in our immediate front were not so
idle as appearances indicated. Looking through the
woods, we could indistinctly see a large body of infantry
making a wide circuit to the right, seemingly with a
view to attack some remote part of the line. A similar
movement took place also to the left. “Look out on the
right!” “Look out on the left!” passed up and down
the line, and every man was on the alert, ready to meet
them should they attempt to carry our intrenchments.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from unseen batteries behind us, comes a
deep roar, and the next moment shell after shell shrieks
through the trees and bursts almost in the rifle-pits. The
thought flashes upon us that the rebels are in our rear,
but is dismissed with the reflection that it is only a Union
battery firing too low, and will soon correct its false
range. Meanwhile our little band had been reduced to
less than four hundred men, embracing two hundred and
seventy of the Twenty-seventh, with small portions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the One Hundred and Forty-fifth Pennsylvania and Second
Delaware; and this force being entirely inadequate to
hold the extended line, Colonel Bostwick dispatched Major
Coburn to General Hancock for reënforcements. In a
few moments the shelling ceased, and far up the road in
front appeared a rebel officer waving a flag of truce, and
slowly advancing, waiting for a recognition. The men
stopped firing in the immediate vicinity of the road,
while for a moment the musketry became more brisk on
the left flank. At length the rebel officer arrived within
a few paces of the works, where he was halted, to await
the presence of Colonel Morris, of the Sixty-sixth New-York,
commanding the whole line. This officer was not
to be found, and the responsibility of receiving the communication
from the flag of truce devolved upon Colonel
Bostwick, of the Twenty-seventh. The rebel&mdash;a tall,
rough specimen, and yet with the manner of a gentleman&mdash;announced
himself as Lieutenant Bailey, of a
Georgia regiment; that he had been sent to inform us
that we were entirely surrounded; that there was no possible
avenue of escape, and therefore he summoned us to
surrender, and thus avoid the loss of life which would
inevitably follow any resistance to the overwhelming
force in front and rear. The Colonel replied that he did
not “see” it, and proceeded to investigate the actual
state of affairs. Meanwhile Lieutenant-Colonel Merwin
went up through the woods in the rear only to find it too
true that the rebels were posted in strong force, to bar
any escape in that direction. Masses of the enemy pouring
in on the right and left, revealed at once the desperate
position in which we were placed, while the singing
bullets from the woods behind as well as in front, indicated
that the foe were closing in upon us. The first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
impulse among officers and men was to attempt to force
our way through. But it was evident that such a course
would result in the destruction of more than half our
number, while the remainder would inevitably fall into
the hands of the enemy. After a hurried consultation
among the officers, a surrender was agreed upon, and the
formality had hardly been completed, when a heavy line
of rebel skirmishers swept out of the woods behind.
Only five minutes before, the men stood at their posts
undisturbed by even a doubt of their security; now, astonished
at the sudden <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">denouement</i>, we found ourselves
about to enter upon the terrible uncertainties of rebel
captivity. And this surprise and mortification was increased
by the conviction that serious disaster must have
overtaken the Union army. The history of the day establishes
the fact, that Saturday’s misfortune, and the
subsequent operations of Sunday morning, compelled the
formation of a new line of battle. The surging conflict had
gradually crowded Hooker back, and late in the afternoon
the army retired, by his order, to a position some distance
in rear of the Chancellor House. As General Hancock
afterward stated, orders were sent down to the Twenty-seventh
to fall back at the same time, but they failed to
reach us; and while the rest of the army had retreated
to the new line, the Twenty-seventh still remained at the
extreme front of the old, entirely unconscious of this
change of position. Our situation in a ravine, surrounded
by dense woods, rendered it impossible to observe
the movements going on in other parts of the extended
field. The enemy, already aware of Hooker’s withdrawal,
immediately planted a battery behind us, supported,
as one of the rebels afterward said, by two brigades of
infantry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>The experience of Major Coburn immediately after
the shelling, while <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> to deliver the Colonel’s request
to General Hancock, more than confirms this statement.
On his way to the rear he was accompanied by
one of our sergeants, severely wounded in the early part
of the action. They had passed hardly half a mile
through the woods when they were taken prisoners, and
the Major was conducted into the road, where he found
a large part of Stonewall Jackson’s corps, under command
of Major-General Anderson. Already they had
formed their skirmish line and were crowding forward
with all possible speed, certain of their prey. Outnumbered
on every hand, and with batteries in front and
rear, it would have been madness to have attempted to
force our way through in the face of such odds. The
gallant Brooke, with characteristic bravery, when he
heard the firing, volunteered to charge down with his
brigade to our relief, but General Hancock refused permission,
for fear of bringing on a general engagement
while the army was changing its position.</p>

<span class="fs60 lsp3">ON TO RICHMOND.</span></h2>


<p>Let us now return to the little band of prisoners in
that woody ravine. As soon as the surrender had been
consummated the men threw away their guns, many of
them with the cartridges, into a rivulet near the intrenchments,
and some cut up their equipments, determined
to afford as little aid and comfort to the rebels as possible.
Our newly-made acquaintances exhibited a most
remarkable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">penchant</i> for cutlery and other conveniences
Yankees are always supposed to have in their possession.
One of the rebel skirmishers had hardly lowered his gun
from an aim, when he walked up to one of our men and
said: “Have you got a knife to sell?” “No;” and
somewhat abashed, he went off to try his luck in a more
promising field. We were now ordered to fall in, and a
part were marched up the road to General Lee’s headquarters,
where the rebels took away our knapsacks,
rubber blankets, shelter-tents, and canteens, and registered
our names. Quite a crowd of butternuts assembled
to view the “Yanks” and prosecute their schemes
of trade.</p>

<p>While we were near headquarters, a General of high
rank rode up, unattended by his staff, and was received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
among his soldiers with a style of cheering or yelling
peculiar to themselves. The rebel chief seemed lost in
deep thought, scarcely noticing the squad of prisoners
or the cheers of his men. The signs of care were strongly
marked upon his iron countenance. Clad in simple
garb, with no prominent badge of distinction, calm and
determined in demeanor, stood before us the commander
of the Army of Northern Virginia, the military pillar of
the rebellion. The General hurriedly retired into his
quarters, and our attention was attracted by a motley
array of rebel soldiery marching up the road. Could
we have forgotten the stern realities of our situation, we
might well have regarded the display as a military burlesque.
On a closer inspection, we found the butternut
phalanx to be composed of tall, lank specimens of “poor
white trash,” with hats slouched in the most approved
style, and knapsacks of every conceivable variety. The
officers were, many of them, equipped with swords of a
most ancient description, which had already filled a term
of service in the olden time. Here is a man with a very
good blanket, and we soon see the letters U.S. displayed
under the folds, while on another back is strapped an
old piece of carpet. A more dirty, seedy, ill-favored,
border-ruffian, ignorant set of men we had never met
before, and this is just the material for an efficient army,
marshalled in defence of treason and slavery.</p>

<p>The preparations were now completed, and under a
strong guard we started off for Spottsylvania Court-House.
The roads were full of Confederate wounded,
moving to the rear. Our route crossed a section of the
battle-field, but all was now quiet; only splintered trees
and lines of breastworks told of the fierce conflicts of
the last few days. At dusk we entered the now historic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
town of Spottsylvania, and passed the night within the
inclosure of the Court-House. A portion of the regiment
remained in the vicinity of the battle ground, and did not
reach the village until the following afternoon. On the
morning of May fourth we resumed our march for
Guinea’s Station, a small hamlet on the Richmond and
Fredericksburg railroad, important as a dépôt of supplies
for Lee’s army. Here seemed to be the general
rendezvous of prisoners, and fifteen hundred had already
been assembled previous to our arrival. Near the station
was the house where Stonewall Jackson lay wounded
and afterward died, an event which clothed the whole
Confederacy in mourning. Our stay at Guinea’s Station
was prolonged until Thursday, May seventh&mdash;three days
of misery, hardly paralleled in any of the experiences of
the whole nine months’ campaign. Tuesday dawned
upon us intensely hot. The broiling rays of the sun
seemed to concentrate upon the large open lot occupied
by the Union prisoners, unrelieved even by a solitary
tree. Later in the day a terrific thunder shower burst
upon us, passing at length into a settled storm, bitterly
raw and cold, continuing all night and the next day
at short intervals. The rain poured in torrents, flowing
in streams across the lot. A ludicrous sight, indeed,
were the nearly two thousand shelterless men, emphatically
squatter sovereigns, scattered about over the field in
speechless resignation, drenched through and through in
the pelting storm.</p>

<p>Thus far we had subsisted on the scanty remains of
Uncle Sam’s rations. “What a fall was there!” when
we descended from Joe Hooker’s generous hospitality to
the frugal fare doled out to us by the rebel commissary.
A brief residence at one of Jeff.’s hotels is an infallible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
remedy for all who are disposed to grumble at army
food. The order is given, “Fall in for rations!” We
had almost concluded that this order would never again
greet our ears until we should once more stand under
the flag of the Union. Immediately our thoughts recurred
to camp near Falmouth, and in imagination floated
visions of beef, pork, hard-tack, fresh bread&mdash;in fact,
Uncle Sam’s army ration loomed up in bolder relief than
ever before. In silent suspense we advance and receive&mdash;three
pints of flour apiece. The inquiry arose, What
shall we do with it? Our extremely limited culinary
facilities soon settled that question. There was but one
alternative, and the men immediately built little fires
and were busily engaged in cooking up a bill of fare for
the march to Richmond, said bill of fare consisting simply
of flour and water mixed together and dried before
the fire. A New-England farmer would regard it as a
personal insult if one should offer such stuff to his hogs.
Even a swill-carrier would indignantly protest.</p>

<p>Many suggestive sights fed our curiosity. Processions
of trains were constantly coming and going from the
station, transporting supplies for Lee’s army. Shabby
army wagons&mdash;regular Noah’s arks mounted on wheels&mdash;horses
and mules reduced to mere skin and bone&mdash;every
thing foreshadowed the ruin of the Confederacy. Thursday
morning, May seventh, we began the march for
Richmond, escorted by the Twelfth South Carolina.
The roads were in an awful condition, in consequence of
recent rains. On the route we passed through Bowling
Green, a few miles east of the railroad, and by evening
reached Milford Station. Just beyond the village we
were obliged to wade the Mattapony river, and halted
for the night in a forest near by. After a toilsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
march, we bivouacked, on Friday evening, a short distance
beyond Hanover Station. At this place each man
received five medium-sized crackers and an ounce of
bacon. Our guards were very incommunicative, but
occasionally sung out, “Git in yer groups of fours dar!”
or ventured an “I reckon,” or a “right smart.”</p>

<p>May ninth seemed to concentrate and intensify all
previous discomforts. The day was exceedingly hot,
and our route lay through a succession of vile swamps,
skirting the Pamunkey and Chickahominy rivers, and extending
to within four or five miles of Richmond. Here
the ground is somewhat higher, and pleasant villas nestle
among the trees, now just assuming the verdure of spring.
As we passed one of these residences, the proprietor&mdash;an
old gentleman&mdash;and the women turned out <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</i> to
view the procession. No doubt we did present a rather
sorry plight; at any rate, these high-bred F. F. V.’s
laughed exultingly, and were loud and profuse in their
remarks, complimentary to Yankees in general and us in
particular. “Oh! well, you have got to Richmond now!”
screeched out one of them with all the impotent ire she
could muster. “Next time we are coming with guns,”
was the reply. “Yes, yes,” chimed in the old man, “we
saw a lot of you fellows last summer over there,” pointing
with his cane in the direction of McClellan’s achievements
in the Chickahominy swamps. Thus a running
fire of words was kept up all along the line.</p>

<p>We could now see in the distance the spires of the
rebel capital. Just outside the city, lines of earthworks,
with here and there a frowning cannon, commanded the
road. Our flattering reception thus far in the villages
along the route from Guinea’s Station led us to expect
even greater demonstrations from the Richmond populace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
As we entered the city, it seemed as if all Richmond
had turned out to view the Yankee parade. The
streets in the suburbs were full of people&mdash;men, women,
and children, whites, negroes, mulattoes&mdash;all in one confused
crowd, and swayed for the most part with clamorous
exultation; while “her beauty and her chivalry,”
arm in arm, gloated over the scene with a kind of fiendish
delight. One old woman, raising her arms in blank
astonishment, screamed out: “Why, all Hooker’s army
is coming!” We thought to ourselves, she is about
right; Hooker’s army will be here one of these days,
and with guns too. “What have you come down here
for?” demanded one, whose very countenance flashed
vengeance. “Oh! we are only Hooker’s advance guard,
come down to act as pall-bearers at Stonewall Jackson’s
funeral,” some one quietly replied. In his rage he answered:
“If you were not a prisoner, I’d shoot you
down.” “You’ve got to Richmond in a way you didn’t
expect.” “See these Yanks; there’s hardly an honest
face among ’em all.” “What a hang-dog look!” These,
and many other expressions, of all degrees of refinement,
were launched at us. It really seemed as if the chivalry
had studied for this very occasion some vocabulary of
Billingsgate, and practiced it beforehand, so as to get it
off in the most approved style of grimace and tone.
Although Richmond was the Sodom and Gomorrah of
treason, and the concentrated essence of rebel villainy
and venom, we were not left entirely to this dark view
of the picture. While we stood in the street, just before
entering Jeff.’s hotel, a German woman, in the kindness
and, I believe, loyalty of her heart, came hurriedly out
from a neighboring house with a large loaf of cake, and
divided it up among the eager men. She then went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
back, but soon returned, laden with a lot of bread, which
she distributed in like manner. Several other instances
of similar character occurred, like flashes of golden sunlight
in a dark and lowering sky.</p>

<p>Wearied by the day’s march and its exciting scenes,
and exhausted through want of food, most of the men
were now ushered into a tobacco factory belonging to
Crew and Pemberton, and situated on Carey street, opposite
the infamous Libby prison, of which it is a counterpart.
More than a thousand men were stowed away
in Crew and Pemberton’s factory, an average of nearly
three hundred in each story. Two hundred and eighty-nine,
including the larger part of the Twenty-seventh,
occupied the upper loft, and when all reclined upon the
floor almost every square foot was covered. Many were
so thoroughly exhausted as to be unable to drag themselves
up-stairs without assistance from their comrades.
Also, Belle Island welcomed a small number to its sands
and wild onions. Forty or fifty of the men were assigned
to Libby prison, where were already quartered
the commissioned officers of the Twenty-seventh. The
latter had arrived in Richmond a day or two previous,
after a journey in crowded cars from Guinea’s Station.
The people residing in the vicinity of the route seemed
in a perfect ferment of vindictive excitement, and gathered
here and there in boisterous groups to gaze at the
unusual pageant. The Virginia women were especially
spiteful, in word and demeanor. Some of them, perched
in conspicuous places, waved little Confederate flags, as
if to attract the more attention, and shouted out, “That’s
what’s the matter!” “Come on, you cursed rascals!”
“Have you got Old Abe with you?” “Ain’t you a sweet-looking
party?” The usual miscellaneous assemblage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
greeted them as they alighted in Broad street, and seemed
very eager to remind them of their advent in the
rebel capital. “Well, you’ve got here, have you?”
“How do you like the place?” “You’re a sweet-looking
crowd of thieves, aren’t you?” Thus they were escorted
to Libby, and handed over to the tender mercies
of Captain Turner and his assistants, who searched the
prisoners, and appropriated all contraband articles.</p>

<p>The day following the arrival of the main body of the
regiment was the Sabbath, just one week since we fell
into rebel hands. During this week all the rations each
man received from the rebel authorities amounted to
three pints of flour, five medium-sized crackers, and an
ounce or two of bacon. All day Sunday the men were
clamorous for something to eat. The guards about the
prison were under strict orders to prevent the people
from selling any thing to the prisoners, but, notwithstanding
this, some articles did pass the blockade. At
evening, the rebels distributed to every four men what
purported to be a four-pound loaf of bread, and a pound
of pork. Less than three pounds of bread would be
nearer the truth, making about ten or twelve ounces for
each man, and this with three ounces of pork formed the
daily ration for one person. As far as it went, it was
very good. Every morning the prison director, with the
rank of major, and his clerk, a renegade New-Yorker&mdash;precious
scoundrels both of them&mdash;came into the prison
to count us over, and see if we were all there.</p>

<p>Thus affairs continued for several days&mdash;the same dull
routine of prison life, varied by nothing except the contraband
reading of Richmond papers, with accounts of
Stonewall Jackson’s funeral, at which there was great
joy in Libby. At length, on Wednesday morning, came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the glad announcement that the United States transports
were at City Point, awaiting our arrival. The
rebel officers administered to us the following paroling
oath: “We, the undersigned, do solemnly swear and
pledge our sacred word, that we will not, during the existing
hostilities between the United States and the Confederate
States of America, aid or abet the enemies of
said Confederate States, by arms or otherwise, until regularly
and legally exchanged, or otherwise released. So
help me God. And we do acknowledge our names appended
to the same, as though signed by ourselves.” At
half-past three in the afternoon, with gladness indescribable,
we left those prison walls, to enter upon the march
to City Point, a place about thirty-five miles from Richmond.
Crossing the James river into Manchester, we
took the turnpike road to Petersburg, under the escort
chiefly of cavalry. The rebels hurried us forward for
miles almost at double-quick, without any halt. As Major
Turner rode by, the men called to him for a rest.
He shouted out, “There is no rest for the wicked!” and
passed on.</p>

<p>It was the purpose of our escort to continue the march
all night, but a thunder-storm of surpassing violence
seriously interfered. A darkness, so intense that we
could not see a foot before us, enveloped the road.
Slowly, through mud, and rain, and darkness, we straggled
along, until near midnight. It was impossible to
go further. Scattered along the roadside for miles were
hundreds too much exhausted to keep up with the column,
and finally we all dragged ourselves into the
marshy woods, and, lulled to sleep by the babbling
brooks flowing around us in every direction, forgot
awhile the fatigue of the march. At an early hour the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
next day the weary column again moves on, each man
sustaining his waning strength by frequent halts. Petersburg
is passed, and ten miles more of mud. At
length the waters of the James river glimmer in the
distance; the old flag, floating proudly at the masthead
of the Union transports, beckons onward. The men attempt
to cheer, but it dies on their lips; nature is too
much exhausted to utter the feelings which swell all
hearts. With renewed energy we press forward, and
soon enter the deserted village of City Point, whose shattered
roofs tell of a former bombardment. That march
from Richmond to City Point stands almost unexampled
in the whole experience of the Twenty-seventh. Many
were ready to drop on the ground from utter inability
to go further. Behind them frowned the grim, historic
walls of Libby; dreary months of incarceration moved
by in slow procession, crowded full with the records of
cruelty, and starvation, and disease; while forward to
freedom and humanity, forward to generous care and protection,
written on every fold of the old flag, fired them
with new determination to toil on. Once more they
stand on a Union deck, resolved to strike a heavier blow
for their country when again they advance to meet her
barbarous foes. As soon as the men were aboard the
transports, a supply of food was distributed to meet their
pressing wants. The steamers quietly dropped down the
beautiful James river, bordered with high banks, rich
in the fresh verdure of spring, with here and there a
handsome villa peering above the trees. We anchored
for the night at Harrison’s Landing, an important point
in the history of the Peninsular campaign. The next
forenoon our transports steamed into Hampton Roads.
Hampton, once the summer resort of the Virginia chivalry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Newport News, the distant spires of Norfolk, the
topmast of the Cumberland still pointing skyward, the little
monitors, and the Rip-Raps, and that grand old sentinel,
Fortress Monroe, all crowd on the view as we round
to at Old Point Comfort. A brief stop, and we are off
again for Annapolis, where we arrive on the morning of
May sixteenth, and are quartered in barracks in the
rear of the town. After three days of rest, we start for
Alexandria, by way of Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac,
and on May twenty-first are introduced within the
narrow precincts of Convalescent Camp.</p>

<p>The majority of the officers were detained in Richmond
several days after the departure of the privates.
Meanwhile, the rebels had been threatening retaliation
for General Burnside’s execution of two spies, in Kentucky;
and the officials in charge of Libby took great
delight in telling our officers that they were to have
tickets in the lottery, which would determine the victims
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex talionis</i>. A few days later, they were relieved
of their suspense by the announcement that the
lot had fallen upon two officers from Tennessee. This
affair having been arranged satisfactorily to the rebel
authorities, the officers of the Twenty-seventh received
their parole early Saturday morning, May twenty-third,
and started in freight cars for City Point, and from that
place were transported, <em>via</em> Fortress Monroe, to Annapolis,
where they arrived on the morning of the twenty-fifth.</p>

<p>Leaving the paroled prisoners of the Twenty-seventh
to endure as best they can the idleness and discontent of
Convalescent Camp, let us return in thought to the wilds
of Chancellorsville, and from those scenes of the third
of May follow the little band which still remains at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
front, to bear our flag to victory on the heights of Gettysburg.
Eight companies were captured on that memorable
May morning; but D and F, having been detached
for duty elsewhere, escaped this unexpected misfortune,
and fell back with the main army, when General
Hooker retired to his new line of battle. Meanwhile,
the duties of these remnants of the regiment were somewhat
disconnected. During Saturday night following
the disaster of the Eleventh Corps, Company A had
been out on picket duty, and were relieved by Company
D, at an early hour the next morning, in time to accompany
the main body of the regiment to the place where
they were captured. Company F had been previously
detached to fill up a gap in the line between the Fifty-third
and One Hundred and Forty-fifth Pennsylvania,
and were soon after ordered up to the Chancellor House
to support the famous Pettit’s battery. Here they remained
until Sunday afternoon, under a severe fire.
Twice the rebels charged up in solid masses, but were
repulsed before Pettit’s rapid and irresistible volleys. In
the evening of that day Company F went out on picket,
and continued in this duty until the following Monday
night. It was on this part of the line that Stonewall
Jackson received his mortal wound.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that when the regiment went
down to the picket-line that Sabbath morning, the colors
remained behind by order of General Brooke. Although
the rifle-pits were now entirely deserted, the color-guard,
having no orders to leave, maintained their position until
ten <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, much of the time under a severe shelling. At
that hour they were ordered to the rear, and soon after
joined Company D, which was the last to leave the old
picket-line of the army, as stated by the staff officer who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
brought to them the orders to fall back. The various
remnants of the Twenty-seventh were not reünited until
a late hour on Monday.</p>

<p>The conflict of Sabbath morning, May third, terminated
at eleven o’clock, and, with the exception of a feeble
demonstration by Jackson’s forces in the afternoon,
the remainder of the day passed in comparative quiet.
Meanwhile, Hooker had contracted his lines, and the
army was now massed within a nearly equilateral triangle,
its base resting upon the Rappahannock. The Eleventh
and Twelfth Corps occupied the side facing Fredericksburg.
On the side looking toward the Rapidan
were the First, Third, and Fifth, while our Second corps
was formed in four compact lines at the angle, which was
open ground about a two-story white house, on the Ely’s
Ford road, near the junction with that leading to United
States Ford. This was a strong position, favorable for
artillery, and justly regarded as the most important in
the whole line. The Twenty-seventh held a position to
the left of the white house, where General Hooker now
had his headquarters. Such continued to be the situation
of the army during the succeeding two days. The
enemy seemed disinclined to venture a general attack,
but occasionally shelled our intrenchments, as if to reassure
themselves that Hooker was still there. Affairs
could not remain long in this doubtful state. The golden
opportunity to crush the rebels, when the thunder
of Sedgwick’s cannon, advancing from Fredericksburg,
filled the breezes with the murmuring notes of success,
had passed, and now every hour of delay added to the
swelling torrent of the Rappahannock, threatening to
sweep away the feeble threads which connected the army
with its supplies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Monday evening, May fourth, General Hooker held a
council of war, which decided that it was best to withdraw
the army the following night. Accordingly, eight
o’clock, Tuesday evening, was the hour fixed upon; but
the troops did not begin to move until after midnight,
in consequence of a heavy storm, which carried away
some of the bridges. The Twenty-seventh remained under
arms all night, in the rain, with orders to be ready
to start at any moment. At length, at four in the morning
of May sixth, the regiment fell back with the rest of
the brigade, re-crossed at United States Ford, and, after
a march of twelve hours, arrived at the old camp, near
Falmouth. The Sixty-fourth New-York were found quietly
ensconced in the few huts which the scavengers of
Falmouth had left standing, and demurred somewhat at
leaving their grateful shelter, but finally recognized the
prior claim of the Twenty-seventh. After a few days,
the regiment changed its camp to a more healthy location
two miles further back from the river. The losses of
Hooker’s campaign had reduced our numbers from nearly
four hundred men to one hundred and sixty, embracing D
and F, and small squads of other companies, the whole
under command of the senior officer, Captain Joseph R.
Bradley, of Company F. Dress parades took place as
usual, and duty at the old picket-line on the Rappahannock
was resumed, bearing very heavily upon our
diminished ranks. Occasionally the rebel pickets shouted
across the river to know where the Twenty-seventh
Connecticut had gone, and in the same breath gave the
answer, “To picket around Richmond.” On the thirteenth
of May, several of our wounded men came over
from Fredericksburg, having been nine days in the rebel
hospitals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>After the battle of Chancellorsville, General D. N.
Couch, the corps commander, was relieved at his own
request, and our division general, W. S. Hancock, justly
characterized as the very impersonation of war, succeeded
to the command. As soon as possible, after the
return of our commissioned officers from Richmond, a
part were exchanged, and at the earliest moment Colonel
Bostwick returned to the front, followed by Lieutenant-Colonel
Merwin, Major Coburn, and Lieutenants
Frank Chapman, Burdict, Rice, Muhlner, and Cross,
who rejoined the regiment on the eleventh of June.
Colonel Bostwick, being prevented from remaining with
his men, in consequence of a severe and protracted sickness,
the Lieutenant-Colonel took command of the battalion,
which now consisted of three companies, an additional
one having been formed from the remnants of
the captured companies, and placed under command of
Captain Jedediah Chapman.</p>

<span class="fs60 lsp3">GETTYSBURG.</span></h2>


<p>The result of the battle of Chancellorsville determined
General Lee to carry out his cherished plan of invading
the North. Hooker’s position in front of Fredericksburg
being unfavorable for attack, the rebel chief early
in June began a series of movements with the view of
drawing him away from the river. Leaving Hill’s corps
in the works at Fredericksburg, to keep up appearances,
he concentrated Ewell’s, Longstreet’s, and Hood’s
forces at Culpepper Court-House, near the upper waters
of the Rappahannock, and about the middle of June
pushed forward rapidly into the Shenandoah Valley, and
either captured or defeated the feeble Union force opposing
his march. Meanwhile, Hooker’s watchful eye was
upon him, and the Sixth Corps crossed the river just below
Fredericksburg to determine the strength and intentions
of the rebels. A few days later, several army
corps broke camp, and started off in the direction of
Warrenton, for the purpose of watching the movements
of the enemy, and covering the approaches to Washington;
while on the ninth the cavalry inflicted a severe
blow upon Jeb. Stuart’s troopers, who were gathering in
strong force at Kelly’s Ford, twenty-five miles above Falmouth,
intending to sweep with destruction the fertile
fields of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The Second Corps was the last to leave the line of the
Rappahannock. On the eighth of June, the Twenty-seventh
Connecticut received orders to be ready to march
at any time, with three days’ rations, and continued in
this waiting posture until the fourteenth instant, when
the final orders came, and at three <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the regiment,
with the rest of the brigade acting as rear-guard to the
corps, moved up the river to Banks’s Ford, relieved our
pickets, reconnoitered the enemy, and retired toward
Stafford Court-House. This little hamlet was left behind
in flames. For several days the corps followed
the roads near the Potomac, passing through Dumfries,
Occoquan, and Fairfax Station, halting here two days,
and arriving at Centreville on the nineteenth. The route
now turned still farther to the left, crossing the old Bull
Run battle-field, which had witnessed the decision of
two campaigns. Time had not effaced the evidences of
those disastrous days. Silently the troops moved over
the field, and the thoughts of many a one among the older
regiments, and of some in our own, hurried back to
those scenes with impressive distinctness, as the bleached
bones of the fallen, or the rubbish of battle, lay scattered
along the roadside. After a severe march of twenty
miles in the rain, the regiment arrived, at ten in the
evening of June twentieth, at Thoroughfare Gap, a wild
gorge in the Blue Ridge. The intensely exhausting
march from Falmouth made the four days of comparative
rest at the Gap exceedingly welcome. Here the
troops were occupied in picketing the pass, in order to
prevent the enemy from crossing the mountains. Meanwhile,
to the north, Stuart and Pleasanton were once
more on the charge at Aldie, Upperville, and Middleburg,
and their muffled cannonade echoed among these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
hills and pleasant valleys, surely not unused to the
sound, repeating itself again and again, as if from as
many different directions.</p>

<p>June twenty-fifth, the regiment fell in at an early hour,
ready to fight or march, as circumstances might require,
for the rebels were approaching with malicious intent to
capture the corps’ beef cattle and supply train, and sharp
picket firing indicated the possible necessity of adopting
the former alternative. But after remaining in line of
battle, with no serious demonstration on the part of the
enemy, the corps advanced through Haymarket, toward
the Potomac. The rebel cavalry followed vigorously,
and attempted to come in on our flanks, but skirmishers
were thrown out, and the troops marched in hollow
squares, prepared to repel any attack. At Haymarket,
the batteries turned on the enemy, and drove them
back. The column pushed forward to Gum Springs, and
without pitching tents rested that night on their arms,
drawn up in a hollow square, ready at a moment’s warning
to meet any assault of rebel cavalry. At midnight
of June twenty-sixth, the regiment crossed the Potomac
at Edward’s Ferry. The next three days passed in
continuous marching up the valley of the Monocacy
river, through many quiet Maryland villages, among
them Poolesville, Frederick City, Liberty, Johnsville, and
Uniontown. Each day’s march was very protracted&mdash;that
from Frederick City to Uniontown embracing a distance
of thirty-six miles, and the manner in which it was
performed elicited high compliments from Colonel
Brooke, commanding the brigade.</p>

<p>Thus far the army had been manœuvred so as to cover
Washington and Baltimore, and now, as the rebel plans
became more apparent, General Meade, who had recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
superseded General Hooker, directed a concentration
of his forces in the vicinity of Gettysburg. The
First Corps held the advance, followed by the Eleventh,
and on Wednesday morning, July first, drove the
enemy’s skirmishers through the town. General Reynolds,
in command of the corps, without hesitation
moved forward to the attack, and met death while
bravely posting his troops on the heights beyond. The
rebels fell back slowly, in order to give time for Ewell’s
men to come to their aid, and this being accomplished,
they were more than a match for the combined First
and Eleventh, with whose now united columns rested the
decision of the day. At three in the afternoon, the
enemy, thus reënforced, took the offensive, and compelled
General Howard, now in command, to withdraw his
troops to the south of the town, and the close of the day
left him securely intrenched on Cemetery Hill.</p>

<p>While these scenes were taking place around Gettysburg,
the Twenty-seventh Connecticut, with its corps,
leisurely moved up to Taneytown, just below the Pennsylvania
State line. Here the troops rested a few hours,
unconscious that the first of a trio of glorious battle days
was already in progress. But soon the ominous notes
of Howard’s and Ewell’s cannon strike on the ear, and
add new emphasis to the call from the front for reënforcements.
Preceded by General Hancock, the corps
advanced rapidly to within three miles of Gettysburg,
and were occupied until midnight in throwing up intrenchments.
At early dawn, July second, the brigades
moved forward to take the places assigned them in the
line of battle. Already the fitful fire of opposing pickets
and skirmishers can be heard in the distance, with the
occasional boom of heavy ordnance. The shock of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
battle, which is to determine the fate of the rebel invasion,
will at the farthest be postponed but a few
hours. Just before coming into position, and while the
troops were resting under arms, the commander of our
brigade assembled the officers, and briefly reminded
them of the desperate character of the emergency, and
urged the importance and necessity of devoting every
energy to insure the successful issue of the conflict.</p>

<p>In order to understand the various positions of the
Twenty-seventh during the action, let us briefly sketch
the line of battle, as adopted by General Hancock, and
along which the several corps were arranged, as they
arrived on the field. Three important roads, the Emmettsburg,
Taneytown, and Baltimore turnpike, converge
in Gettysburg from the south. At their junction, just
below the town, is the natural key of the position, the
now historic Cemetery Hill. This elevation forms the
northern end of a ridge prolonged about four miles, almost
exactly due south, near to and parallel with the
Taneytown road, gradually diminishing in altitude until
it almost loses itself in the surrounding level, then rises
again into the forest-crowned Little Round Top, or
Weed’s Hill, and terminates in the yet higher ascent of
Rocky Round Top itself. Beginning on the left at Round
Top, the Union line extends northward in nearly a
straight course along Cemetery Ridge, and at Cemetery
Hill bends back to the east in the general form of a
half circle, with a radius of three fourths of a mile&mdash;Culp’s
Hill, and several minor eminences, lying in the
circumference; and the extreme right, crossing Rock
Creek, which flows at the base of these heights, rests
upon the woody summit of Wolf’s Hill. The rebel
forces occupied a series of heights corresponding to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
these, with an intervening belt of comparatively level
and open country from one to two miles in width.</p>

<p>The forenoon of Thursday, July second, passed with
no demonstration on either side. The hostile forces are
rapidly marshalling on the opposite ridges. In the
Union line the Twelfth Corps holds the eminences near
Rock Creek, on the right; next is the First, on Culp’s
Hill; then the Eleventh, at the centre, on Cemetery Hill,
while along Cemetery Ridge are successively drawn up
the Second, Third, and Fifth, with the Sixth in reserve
near the Taneytown road. The Twenty-seventh Connecticut
was stationed about a mile and a half south of
Cemetery Hill, in the line occupied by our Second Corps
on the left centre. Here the regiment remained nearly
all day in quiet preparation for the conflict, which
threatened at any moment to mar that peaceful landscape
of thrifty farm-houses and waving grain.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon, the Third Corps, on the left of
the Second, advanced down the western slope of Cemetery
Ridge, through woods and an extensive wheat-field,
almost to the Emmettsburg road, which winds through
the narrow valley, separating the hostile forces. Just
beyond, Longstreet is forming his brigades, and at four
o’clock, preceded by a brief cannonade, their gray ranks
sweep out from woods and ravines, and once more is
heard that strange, wild yell, as they throw themselves
forward upon the thin line of the Third Corps. But
before the storm of grape and canister from Cemetery
Ridge they quickly fall back to organize anew their
broken columns. Meanwhile reënforcements from the
Fifth and Second Corps moved rapidly to the scene of
action. Once more in still heavier masses the enemy
advanced to the charge. The Twenty-seventh, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the rest of the First Division, was hurried forward
through fields and by-roads, to support the faltering
line. As the regiment enters the wheat-field, already
referred to, the broken remains of the Third Corps are
slowly retiring to the rear. A few steps more bring the
men under the full sweep of the enemy’s fire. Lieutenant-Colonel
Merwin falls while leading the command
with his accustomed bravery. Under Major Coburn,
the line still presses forward at double-quick, through
the wheat-field and woods beyond, driving the rebels a
quarter of a mile, across a ravine, which on the further
side rises into a precipitous ledge. The men with
much difficulty clambered up the rocky steep, but as they
appeared upon the crest of the hill, the enemy, drawn
up in readiness just beyond, within pistol-range, opened
upon them a withering fire. The contest at this point
continued for some time. Planting the colors upon the
top, the men loaded their pieces under shelter of the
brow of the hill, then, rising up, delivered their fire.
Meanwhile the troops to our right gave way, and, taking
advantage of the exposed position of the right flank of
our brigade, the enemy advanced a body of troops in
that direction, and General Brooke at length ordered
our shattered line to fall back, which was accomplished
under a heavy cross-fire.</p>

<p>Thus with varying success the battle raged from
four <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> until dark. Now the feeble line of the Third
Corps trembles before the fierce onset of the foe, and retires,
contesting the ground inch by inch; but the irresistible
onslaught of reënforcements soon turns the tide.
Again the rebels push back the Union troops almost to
the original lines on Cemetery Ridge, and again are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
themselves repulsed before the concentrated fire of our
artillery, aiding the charge of a brigade of infantry.</p>

<p>The conflict on the left wing terminated at dark,
leaving the enemy in possession of the wheat-field. No
attack had yet been made upon other parts of the line,
but, as the day closed, a division, deploying from the
edge of the town, made a brief and desperate, but fruitless,
assault upon the batteries posted on Cemetery Hill.
And still further to the right, the enemy, observing that
the larger part of the forces on Culp’s Hill had been
drawn off to meet pressing emergencies elsewhere,
crossed Rock Creek, and, charging up the woody slope,
secured a lodgement for the night in the unoccupied portion
of the works. Such was the general result of the
day’s fighting.</p>

<p>The Twenty-seventh went into action with seventy-five
men, all that could be mustered for duty after an
active service of not quite nine months. At the camps
of paroled prisoners, the Richmond voyagers of our
regiment, though not permitted to rejoin the command,
yet in thought followed their comrades through all the
vicissitudes of march and battle which attended them.
At five <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> that little band of seventy-five men formed
for the charge at the edge of the wheat-field. At dark
thirty-eight were numbered among the casualties: eleven
killed&mdash;among them Lieutenant-Colonel Merwin, and
Captain Jedediah Chapman&mdash;twenty-three wounded,
and four missing. One of the latter, when Lee’s army
retreated, was marched by his captors from Gettysburg
to Staunton, Virginia, one hundred and eighty miles,
and thence transported by railroad to Richmond. After
a six weeks’ experience on Belle Island, he was paroled,
and returned home so emaciated and worn down by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
hardship as to be almost beyond recognition even by
members of his own company.</p>

<p>At the close of the action in front of the left wing,
the Twenty-seventh was assigned a new position in the
line of battle, about midway on the ridge between
Cemetery Hill and Round Top. The regiment remained
in this vicinity until the Second Corps started
in pursuit of Lee’s army, three days later. Early the
next morning, July third, the men were roused from
sleep by a furious cannonade from batteries posted on
Power’s Hill, about half a mile to the rear. These dogs
of war were paying their morning compliments to the
rebels, who still occupied the works on the extreme
right, which they had captured the previous evening.
For an hour this thunder-toned reveille awoke the resting
armies to the still fiercer drama of the last battle
day. The infantry followed up this fiery prelude with
a vigorous attack upon the rebel vantage-ground, the
importance of which seemed fully appreciated by both
sides. The struggle continued with unabated resolution
until nine o’clock, when the Union forces succeeded in
dispossessing the enemy of this to them valuable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">point
d’appui</i> for future operations.</p>

<p>With the exception of a severe artillery fire, to which
General Meade’s headquarters were subjected, the enemy
attempted nothing further during the remainder of the
forenoon. The Twenty-seventh was busily engaged in
throwing up intrenchments, gathering for this purpose
rails and stones from neighboring fences, and, in the absence
of picks and shovels, using their bayonets and tin
plates to heap up the earth. In his morning rounds,
General Hancock visited the brigade, and as he stood
near by, conversing with Major Coburn, our acting Brigadier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Colonel Brooke, called the General’s attention to
the little remnant of the Twenty-seventh, alluding, in
strong terms of commendation, to the conduct of the
regiment in the action of the preceding afternoon. Turning
to the men, General Hancock said: “Stand well to
your duty now, and in a few days you will carry with
you to your homes all the honors of this, the greatest
battle ever fought upon the continent.”</p>

<p>From eleven o’clock until one, only stifled mutterings
of the impatient storm disturbed the quiet which reigned
along the lines. The rebels were silently maturing their
plans for the last grand charge, upon which they staked
the fate of the invasion. Those were hours of indescribable
suspense to the defenders of the Union, whether or
no the sun would set upon a foe elated with victory and
pressing onward to new conquests, or sullenly retiring in
defeat. At one o’clock the combat began. From every
commanding eminence in their concave line, the rebel
artillery, numbering more than a hundred guns, opened
a terrific cannonade, probably unsurpassed in violence
during the whole war. For more than an hour this wild
storm of shot and shell rolls over the Union line, from
Round Top to Rock Creek. The infantry are partially
sheltered behind intrenchments, while the cannoneers
stand at their posts, replying occasionally to the bombardment,
but reserving their fire for more decisive work,
when the rebel forces advance to the assault. At length
the cannonade slackens, to give way to the next act in
the drama, the crisis of the tragedy. In full view two
heavy lines of troops, the flower of the rebel army, with
skirmishers in front, deploy from the woods and ridges
beyond the Emmettsburg road. With the steadiness of
hardened veterans they move forward to the attack.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
From Cemetery Ridge thousands of Union troops are
watching their progress, for the assault is directed upon
the left centre. On arriving at the road, the enemy
opened a heavy musketry fire, and dashed rapidly forward
across the level plain. The very moment they
emerged from behind Seminary Heights, the Union artillery
met them with shot and shell and solid shot, but
now, as they approach within easy range, their ranks are
mercilessly raked with a tempest of canister. Cemetery
Hill is wreathed with flame from the guns of thickly-massed
infantry, and the fringe of fire courses along the
crest of the ridge for two miles, as far as the rebel attack
extends. Though temporarily checked, one division
still marches on with desperate energy up to the very
works. Only a weak line bars their progress, but reinforcements
quickly arrive at the critical point, around
which the contending hosts now struggle, in one of the
most hotly-contested encounters of the battle. For a
time the rebels bravely maintain their position, but
clouds of missiles from Cemetery Hill tear into their
ranks, while infantry crowd them vigorously in front and
flank. At length, leaving the ground thickly strewn
with killed and wounded, and multitudes as prisoners in
the hands of the conquerors, the broken remnants roll
back in wild confusion, and disappear behind the hills
from which they had sallied forth.</p>

<p>This last charge of the rebels took place just to the
right of the position held by the Twenty-seventh, which
we have already referred to as being half-way between
Round Top and Cemetery Hill. From the relation of
the ground to the surrounding high land, the location of
our brigade was regarded as one of the weakest in the
line, and General Hancock expressed the opinion that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
here the enemy would make his attack. Fortunately it
proved otherwise, although for a time such a movement
seemed imminent. Near the close of the action, a division,
massed in column, advanced directly upon our front,
but the reserve artillery quickly drove them back before
they came within musketry range. The favorable termination
of what was felt to be the last assault the rebels
would make, produced a profound feeling of satisfaction.
But one of the saddest of duties remained to be performed&mdash;to
bury the dead and gather the wounded into the
hospitals. This work occupied the men during July
fourth. On that day, Lee’s army withdrew from this
scene of inglorious defeat, and retired in a southwesterly
direction.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of July fifth, the war-worn Twenty-seventh,
with the Second Corps, left those battle-scarred
heights, the theatre of a costly but substantial triumph,
which marks the turning-point in the fortunes of the rebellion.
For the next few days the march was directed
toward the Potomac, following at first the Taneytown
road. But slow progress was made, in consequence of
frequent rains and the thoroughly exhausted condition of
the troops. The state of popular feeling along the route
was in striking contrast with the dejected aspect of every
countenance when the army was on its way to Gettysburg.
Now, Frederick City put on its most smiling
face. Flags were flung to the breeze, and the people
gave an enthusiastic welcome to the regiments as they
passed through in pursuit of Lee’s army. The route
now crossed the Blue Ridge, by way of Crampton’s
Gap. Here the severe rains had gathered a considerable
torrent, several feet deep, which formed the pathway of
the troops for nearly two miles. The Twenty-seventh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
was once more in the vicinity of the enemy, who had retreated
down the western slope of the mountains, and
were now in position at Williamsport, on the Potomac,
preparing to cross into Virginia. The sound of cannon
in that direction informed us that they were but a short
distance to the front; and while on the field of Antietam,
the brigade formed in line of battle, as a precautionary
measure. The next day the rebel cavalry attacked the
skirmish line, but quickly fell back before a severe shelling.
In anticipation of further fighting, the men spent
two nights and one day in building an elaborate line of
intrenchments; but it proved to be labor lost, as the rebels
retired, on the night of the fourteenth, to the south
bank of the river. Immediately on ascertaining this
fact, the Twenty-seventh, with the brigade, was ordered
down to Falling Waters, a short distance below Williamsport,
and arrived there just in time to witness the
capture of the enemy’s rear-guard, more than a thousand
strong.</p>

<p>The invasion was now at an end; and as the last rebel
left the soil of Maryland, the campaign of the Twenty-seventh
drew near to its close. Leaving Falling Waters,
the regiment accompanied the Second Corps down the
Potomac to Harper’s Ferry, and went into camp at Pleasant
Valley, about two miles distant. On the morning
of July eighteenth the Twenty-seventh ceased its connection
with the Army of the Potomac. In announcing
this event, Colonel Brooke, our brigade commander,
issued the following general order:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="pad4">“<span class="smcap">Headquarters Fourth Brigade, First Division, }<br />
<span class="pad4">Second Corps, Camp in Pleasant Valley,</span> }<br />

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">General Order&mdash;No. 9.</span></p>

<p>“The term of service of the Twenty-seventh Connecticut
Volunteers having nearly expired, it has been relieved
from further duty, and ordered to report to its
place of enrolment.</p>

<p>“The Colonel commanding the brigade desires, in
parting with the officers and men of the Twenty-seventh
Connecticut, to convey to them his sincere feelings of
regret at losing their services, while at the same time he
thanks them for the obedience and faithfulness which
have been a marked feature of the regiment.</p>

<p>“Knowing it intimately for so many months of active
and arduous service&mdash;having been an eye-witness of
its many deeds of gallantry, and of the noble devotion
displayed by it on many a memorable day, during the
time in which he has had the honor to command its services&mdash;he
feels it a duty he owes, not only to the living
heroes, but to the memory of those who have fallen in
the field in battling in our righteous cause, to bear testimony
to the valor and gallantry it has always displayed.</p>

<p>“Side by side with the veterans of the Army of the
Potomac it has fought, and by the gallantry of its conduct
won for itself an enviable name and reputation, and
which may well, in after years, cause all who belong to
it to feel a pardonable pride in having it to say that they
served with the Twenty-seventh Connecticut.</p>

<p class="right">“By order. <span class="smcap pad6">Colonel Brooke.</span></p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Charles P. Hatch</span>, Lieutenant,<br />
<span class="pad4">“Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.”</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>With glad hearts the men formed in line at an early
hour and took the cars for Baltimore, after a parting
salute to the brigade, as it marched by on its way into
Virginia. On the twentieth, the detachments of paroled
men from Annapolis and Camp Convalescent arrived at
Baltimore, and the whole regiment, now mustering about
half the original number, started by railroad for New-Haven.
Once more we were entertained at the “Volunteer
Refreshment Saloon,” in Philadelphia, and, after a
night’s bivouack at the Battery, in New-York, arrived
at the “place of enrolment” on the twenty-second of
July, 1863, exactly nine months from the date of departure
for the field. We shall not attempt to describe the
hearty enthusiasm and deep feeling of the reception
which followed. That “glorious welcome home” will
long be remembered by the soldiers of the Twenty-seventh.
Escorted by the military companies of the
city and the municipal authorities, the regiment marched
from the cars to the north portico of the State House,
while “Welcome!” pealed from the ringing bells, thundered
in the roar of cannon, waved from every flag-staff,
and shone on every countenance of the vast multitude,
gathered from all parts of the county, and thronging
the streets and public square. At the State House, after
the regiment had been drawn up “in column by division,”
the Mayor presented the formal welcome of the city, and
was succeeded by Rev. Dr. Bacon in a brief address, closing
with a prayer of thanksgiving. The following poem,
written by Mrs. William Doty, of New-Haven, and accompanying
a gift of laurel wreaths to the field-officers,
was then read:</p>

<p>At the conclusion of these exercises a bountiful collation
was served up, after which the men separated, to
await the completion of the papers necessary to the final
muster out of service, which took place July twenty-seventh,
1863.</p>

<p>Thus terminated the eventful campaign of the Twenty-seventh
Connecticut Volunteers. During this brief term
of nine months, the regiment performed marches in Virginia,
Maryland, and Pennsylvania, amounting to no less
than five hundred miles, and participated in three of
the great battles of the war&mdash;Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville,
and Gettysburg&mdash;losing in killed and wounded
in the first, about one third, and in the last, one half, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
those present in action. Very many of our number, on
their return, reënlisted in other organizations, and illustrated
on new fields the same valor which bore them and
their comrades up the fiery slope of Fredericksburg,
nerved all hearts calmly to meet disaster in the wilderness
of Chancellorsville, and crowned with victory the
heights of Gettysburg.</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>The necrology of the Twenty-seventh, during the
whole term of service, includes seventy-five officers and
men, and embraces much that was noblest in the regiment.
Of this number thirty-three fell amid the strife
and turmoil of battle; eighteen, after a more or less
lingering period of patient agony, finally succumbed to
their wounds; and twenty-four others slowly yielded to
the inroads of disease, and died among the more quiet
scenes of the hospital. Were it possible, we would
gladly dwell upon each individual name, and gather up
those qualities by which each is remembered among his
comrades. But after all that might be said, the simple
record of the central fact in their history, that these
men fell in defence of the most righteous cause ever
submitted to the decision of the sword, is far more impressive
than any commemorative words. And yet there
are some whose marked character and prominent connection
with the regiment as a whole, or with single
companies, seem to demand more than a passing notice.
Chief among these, the mind and heart of each member
of the regiment will at once recur to the name of</p>

<p class="pfs100">LIEUT.-COL. HENRY C. MERWIN,</p>

<p class="noindent">who fell in the battle of Gettysburg, July second,
1863. If this noble spirit must leave its mortal tenement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
amid the wild tumult of war, how appropriate that
it should be when the black cloud of disaster, which had
so long hovered over the cause of our country, was just
rolling away, and already revealed its silver lining of
victory!</p>

<p>Colonel Merwin was a native of Brookfield, Connecticut,
where he was born September seventeenth, 1839.
He spent the greater part of his life in New-Haven, and
at the beginning of the war was in business with his
father and brother. He early manifested a fondness for
military life, to which the subsequent events of his history
proved him well adapted. When the first gun of the
war sounded from the rebel batteries at Charleston, it
awoke in his breast a determined and prompt response.
At that time he was a member of the New-Haven Grays,
and immediately volunteered with that corps for three
months’ service in the Second Regiment, holding the
position of sergeant. It will be remembered that that
was one of the very few regiments which returned with
credit from the field of Bull Run. After this brief campaign
he remained at home for a season, constrained by
considerations of filial duty, by which a noble nature
like his is ever governed until yet higher obligations
demand attention. The armies of the Union were being
rapidly filled up, and at length the Government stopped
recruiting, while the nation beheld with confidence the
vast and apparently irresistible preparations, which betokened
an easy victory. Under these circumstances it
was not strange that so many, like Colonel Merwin, held
back by peculiar home duties, refrained from throwing
themselves into the struggle. But these anticipations
resulted in disappointment, and all this array of resources
proved a disastrous failure. The call of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
country was now heard in louder and more imperative
tones than ever before, and appealed to a far wider circle
in the community. Henry C. Merwin responded with a
calm, but earnest alacrity, as is ever true of those whose
guide is duty. His deserved and unsought popularity
soon gathered to his banner a full quota of men, which
was designated as Company A of the Twenty-seventh.
Subsequently, at the organization of the regiment, he was
chosen Lieutenant-Colonel by the votes of his fellow-officers.
From this point his history is identified with
that of the regiment. From the moment of departure
for the field to the time of his death in that terrible
combat of July second, at Gettysburg, he had never
been relieved from duty, except as the casualties of war
separated him from his command. He shared the fortunes
of the regiment during the terrible and fruitless
battle of Fredericksburg, and met with undaunted
courage the sudden shock of disaster in the thickets of
Chancellorsville. He visited Richmond as a prisoner
of war, and on being exchanged at once returned to the
regiment, to the command of which he was now called.
Along the weary march to Gettysburg he inspired the
men with his own indomitable spirit, and on that fated
wheat-field, where the missiles of the enemy, as it were,
mowed down the waving grain, he fell, mortally
wounded, breathing out those words of noble self-forgetfulness,
“My poor regiment is suffering fearfully.”</p>

<p>Without disparagement to any, it may truly be said
that no officer in the regiment attracted to himself such
universal and unvarying respect, confidence, and affection
among the men of his command. Nor was this strange
in view of the remarkable and harmonious combination
of noble qualities in his character. No pride of position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
ever marred the beautiful consistency of his life, and
yet there was a natural dignity which forbade undue
familiarity. He felt deeply the responsibility of his relation
to the regiment, and this o’ermastering principle
swallowed up every consideration of self-interest. Duty
was evidently the supreme motive of his life, and intent
upon the performance of his own, he expected and required
equal faithfulness on the part of others. He was
quick of discernment, and rapid in execution, but no
harshness ever dimmed the transparent kindness of his
demeanor. His genial countenance and words of sympathy
and encouragement often cheered the loneliness
of the hospital. He thoroughly appreciated the hardships
and trials peculiar to the private soldier, and at
all times endeavored to sustain and inspirit his weary
energies. All these more amiable qualities were supplemented
by a manly independence and decision, which
made him always jealous for the rights of his men. On
that trying march to Gettysburg, no arrogance and
severity of superior officers ever deterred him from a
gentlemanly, but bold and firm, maintenance of the
rights and interests of the regiment. He at once secured
the respect, and soon the high regard of Colonel
Brooke, commanding the brigade, who felt most keenly
the loss of Colonel Merwin, and, on hearing that he was
wounded, gave orders that every thing possible should
be done for his welfare.</p>

<p>But none can do justice to such a character. In his
death the Twenty-seventh laid its costliest sacrifice upon
the altar of our country.</p>

<div class="caption">
ADDISON C. TAYLOR,<br /><br />
<span class="smcap lsp2">Captain of Company C</span>.</div>
</div>

<p>This gallant officer fell severely wounded in the
engagement at Fredericksburg, December thirteenth,
1862, and died at his home in New-Haven, March thirteenth,
1863. He was born October twenty-eighth,
1841, in Wellington, Lorraine county, Ohio. His parents
were natives of Connecticut, which State became
his home when he was about twelve years of age. For
several years he was a pupil in the Collegiate and Commercial
Institute of New-Haven, and subsequently a
teacher, and also the military instructor in that school.
The outbreak of the rebellion in 1861 found him performing
the duties of this position. Though feeling
that his relations and duties to others did not permit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
him at that time to enter the active military service of
the country, yet he took an earnest and enthusiastic
part in the stirring scenes of that period. Troops were
to be raised and prepared for the field with the utmost
dispatch. How vividly memory recalls the experiences
of those days, then so strange in our national history,
when men were gathering from all quarters for the
nation’s defence, and our streets resounded with the
drum and fife, and the public square was alive with
squads and companies moving to and fro in the mazes
of military evolutions! Captain Taylor’s zeal and military
knowledge found an ample sphere for exercise at
this important crisis, and truly most efficient service did
he render. It should be particularly mentioned, that he
drilled the company of Captain, now Brevet Major-General,
Joseph R. Hawley, then of the First Connecticut
Regiment of three months’ volunteers. Brevet Brigadier-General
Edward W. Whittaker, the adventurous cavalry
leader, was also at that time a member of this company.
So successfully did Captain Taylor fulfil these duties
that Captain Hawley offered him the most flattering inducements
if he would consent to accompany the regiment;
but the time had not arrived when he was to
give even life itself for his country. It came when the
battle summer of 1862 convinced the nation that this
was no ordinary struggle, and brought each man face to
face with the question of his own individual duty. At
this juncture the call was issued for volunteers for nine
months’ service; and Captain Taylor, with his accustomed
ardor, immediately entered upon the work of
recruiting the “Monitors” for the Twenty-seventh Regiment,
and soon assembled about him a very superior
body of men, to whom his military knowledge and experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
were of very great advantage. His was the
color company, and at its head he moved on that day
of fearful carnage, the memorable thirteenth of December,
1862, when he received the wound which resulted
in death, after three months of patient suffering.</p>

<p>Did space allow, we might appropriately introduce at
this point the singularly unanimous testimony of those
who knew him best, to the self-reliance which he manifested
from his earliest years; to the thorough, unostentatious
sincerity, purity, and conscientiousness of his
life; to the high sense of duty which impelled him to
the field, and animated him in every act; and, more
than all this, to the Christian principles which formed
the basis of his symmetrical character.</p>

<div class="caption">
JEDEDIAH CHAPMAN, <span class="smcap">Jr.</span>,<br /><br />
<span class="smcap lsp2">Captain of Company H.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Death singled out another shining mark when Captain
Chapman fell in the fore-front of battle, on the same
afternoon that beheld the close of Colonel Merwin’s life.
Two congenial spirits in nobility and worth together
passed to the land of immortality on that day of death’s
high carnival.</p>

<p>Jedediah Chapman, Jr., was born in New-Haven,
November twenty-first, 1839. Like Colonel Merwin,
he was a member of the New-Haven Grays at the opening
of the war, and accompanied them to the field as a
private in the three months’ service. When the Twenty-seventh
was being recruited under the call for nine
months’ troops, he took hold of the work with vigor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
and was in great part instrumental in raising Company
H, of which he was chosen First Lieutenant. During
more than one third of the campaign he had command of
the company, and to his exertions and military experience
its efficiency was largely due. Amid the terrors
of that disastrous day at Fredericksburg, no one
acquitted himself with greater bravery and coolness than
Lieutenant Chapman. In consequence of protracted
sickness during the spring of 1863, he did not participate
in the battle of Chancellorsville, and thus escaped
the fate of the regiment. But it was a great disappointment
to him not to be with his men, and share with
them the vicissitudes of the campaign. By reason of the
disaster to the Twenty-seventh in that battle, only two
companies of the regiment remained in the field, with a
few remnants of those which were captured. These
scattering portions were formed into one company, and
Lieutenant Chapman was placed in command. His
peculiar qualifications of discipline and character contributed
much to their unity and effectiveness during
the succeeding campaign of Gettysburg; and at their
head he fell on the second of July, 1863. His commission
as Captain of Company H, dated May thirteenth,
1863, had been already issued and forwarded; but he
did not live to know of this well-deserved honor.</p>

<p>Much that has already been said of Colonel Merwin
might, with equal propriety, be applied to Captain
Chapman. He was an officer well known, and highly
esteemed, not only in his own company, but throughout
the regiment. He possessed in a peculiar degree all the
elements which constitute an efficient, and yet popular,
commander. In all his relations, he manifested a genial
frankness of manner, a conscientiousness of purpose, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
keen sense of justice, which at once gained universal
confidence and regard. He was one of the most unassuming
of men, and yet in that soul burned a depth of
devotion to duty, and a power of noble action, which
seemed to require the stern, trying scenes of war to
bring them forth in their original strength and glory.
So long as the campaign of the Twenty-seventh lives in
the memory of those who participated in it, so long
will the members of Company H cherish the name and
reputation of their beloved commander, Jedediah Chapman.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let us now turn to the long catalogue of enlisted
men, whose names appear in the necrology of the regiment.
History can never do justice to the grandeur
and far-reaching importance of the cause to which they
gave the testimony of their lives, nor can it do justice to
the nobility and value of the sacrifice. It is not necessary
to repeat in this place the names of these worthy
men; but we will call to mind a few representatives of
their number. There was Orderly-Sergeant Richard H.
Fowler, of Company A, who died of wounds received
at Fredericksburg. He was a native of Guilford, and
one of a family whose record for active patriotism and
sublimity of sacrifice has few, if any, parallels during
the whole war. Corporal William A. Goodwin and
Private Augustus B. Fairchild likewise fell at Fredericksburg.
To the efficiency and worth of them all, the
officers of the company bear willing testimony. Companies
C, D, E, and F, also suffered severely in the loss
of faithful and tried soldiers. The battle of Fredericksburg
struck from the roll of Company H some of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
most valued members. Among these were Orderly-Sergeant
Thomas E. Barrett, and Corporals George H.
Mimmac and Frank E. Ailing. Sergeant Barrett was
a man of very superior character and education. Previous
to his enlistment he had been a much-esteemed
teacher at the Eaton Public School in New-Haven.
The pleasant duties and associations of this position,
and all its prospects of usefulness, he yielded up to
enter the service of the country. Few made greater
sacrifices, or made them more cheerfully, than he, in
obedience to a purely unselfish sense of duty. He
sought and expected no office, and only at the earnest
solicitation of his comrades consented to accept the
post of First Sergeant, and certainly no company ever
had a more faithful and conscientious officer. He was
a noble Christian soldier; a man whom society could ill
afford to lose. But he has left behind him an example
which should be carefully cherished and regarded. The
sacrifice of such a man is of no ordinary value, and
gives unusual significance to the struggle through which
the nation has passed. Corporals Mimmac and Ailing
possessed very similar elements of character. The latter
was a member of Yale College at the time he enlisted,
and left the congenial pursuits of a student’s life to respond
to what he regarded the call of duty. Such were
some of the men the ranks of the Twenty-seventh contributed
to that roll of honored names, whose heroism
and self-sacrifice will grow brighter and brighter, as
the progress of years reveals, in all their meaning and
influence, the events of the war for Liberty and Union.</p>
